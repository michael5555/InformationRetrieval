8,dear god that was one of the most incredible movies i ve ever seen  going into it i knew only a few things that it takes place in world where women have become infertile and one woman has become pregnant  clive owen must guide her to safety there s a long take in a car and julianne moore gets shot yeah  it sucks that that part got spoiled for me but i was in shock it happened so early on in the movie but i had no idea that this film would be so incredible  every performance was incredible  not a single weak one the cinematography is some of the greatest i have seen and was honestly better than lubezki s in the revenant every single shot was filmed so incredibly and had me sucked in and dear god that long take when theo is navigating the city at the end was one of the best tracking shots i ve ever seen overall any small flaws i may have with this movie in subsequent watches will be overshadowed by everything else being perfect one of the best movie s i ve ever seen  1010  just one question though  what really was the fishes true motives  did they want the baby to survive or not  and what did they want to do with it  i m a little confused there ,466ix2,movies,entertainment,1455682980.0,MojaveWalker,10.0,0.0,6942,3348,0.0

88,agreed wholeheartedly this movie is why  frankly  i was kind of disappointed with gravity  which was also directed by alfonso cuaron   technically gravity is breathtaking but is still this spacestation hopping modern tale of survival children of the men  on the other hand  is a fictitious world working on this fantastic premise that still works why  it s because it seems to effortlessly saturate us with little things to suggest that this world exists the religious protesters  the ringing in his ears  the family portraits around the room  to answer your question about the fishes i think it was best left ambiguous to pin it to a simple answer  i think they wanted the baby to live and for them to prey upon the blind desperation of the world on the other side of the coin cinematically  think about the little girl in waterworld she is presented as symbol to acquire control in a postapocalyptic world ,d02v8b2,movies,entertainment,1455684997.0,Bunyip_Jack,1.0,0.0,11,5844,0.0

579,how rooney mara was nt nominated alongside cate blanchett in the best actress category when she had six more minutes of screen time is beyond me really  academy  does jennifer lawrence need another oscar nomination  but i digress  this movie was stunning  both visually and emotionally  as  ultimately  it s a love story a doomed one  but a love story nonetheless the two protagonists  carol and therese  are so likable when they re separate  but they have palpable chemistry when they re together  which is what a lot of romance movies forget to do nowadays  the two lovers need to be sympathetic on their own if we ever expect to like them when they re together but  through scenes of carol interacting with her young daughter  and therese s interactions with her coworkers and friends  we see that these are interesting characters that an audience can get behind and more importantly  we see that they are both stuck in a situation that they do nt want to be in  a large portion of why this movie is so good has to do with its actors as i mentioned earlier  blanchett and mara are basically pitch perfect as the two lovers in this film they  along with director todd haynes  really know how to capture both the romance and the tragedy that comes along with being lesbians in that moment in history every time they share a scene together  their chemistry is damn near tangible you can tell that they felt very comfortable around one another and supporting roles from kyle chandler and sarah paulson certainly helped propel the characters  relationships forward even further  a lot of people were upset that this was nt nominated for best picture and best director and yeah  i get it now this is a near perfect romance movie  gay or straight  and everyone should see it as soon as possible ,466ddb,movies,entertainment,1455680743.0,FredVogel,6.0,0.0,1,31,0.0

590,the similar roles of tom hardy and eric bana some of the similarities are the sort of things you d find on a lot of actors cvs  they were both in black hawk down  they both played heroes of greek myth  members of the british nobility  70s intelligence operatives etc even the fact they ve both played incredibly musclebound comic book characters is nt too much of a stretch with all the superhero movies around now  but a couple of the coincidences are definitely oddly specific  for example they ve both played bald star trek villains from the romulan empire who plotted to destroy earth with super weapons  shinzon and nero  and they ve both played notorious prison hard men with distinctive facial hair in biopics named for the characters alias  bronson and chopper   one final coincidence is that bana was inspired to get into acting after watching mad max  his first car was the same model as max s pursuit special and he even made a documentary about his love for it but of course when they came to recast max  rather than the australian bana  they went with hardy ,d02p7gx,movies,entertainment,1455674920.0,disposableday,6.0,0.0,4,11361,0.0

611,i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i do nt know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got  i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that do nt know  it s based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt  who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver  whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type  who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed  lauda was played by daniel bruhl  you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds  and i truly think  without hyperbole  that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career is nt as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy  and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey s performance in dallas buyers club matt did well do nt get me wrong  but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming  just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan  and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy  but honestly   the whole cast was perfect   http  wtf1coukwpcontentuploads2013098m7vtxe1024x778jpg   it s actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park  it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact  one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he s banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them  peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think it s interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other  i think that s one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life does nt normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made  rush  feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times  whether or not they re on the track  but as far as the directing  howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track  there s a very raw scene in a hospital which i wo nt spoil  but it s hard to watch   but i think the best part of the whole movie  and what made it one of the best experiences i ve ever had in a theater  was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable  and makes you feel like you re watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters  i felt like i was actually on the race track i m so  so glad i was one of the  apparently few  people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters ca nt match  but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to marty s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader  i really ca nt recommend  rush  more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie ,45yhrm,movies,entertainment,1455567700.0,MasterLawlz,506.0,0.0,117403,118750,0.0

662,it is a niche thing i love vintage f1 related stuff  so i really enjoyed rush daniel bruhl absolutely  nailed  playing niki luada but for those who do nt give a shit about auto racing  it was probably just a decent movie i still like grand prix  1966  better  though it is fictional instead of biographical the incar racing scenes and race footage were much better imo more intense racing footage may have broadened the appeal of rush  but it was still pretty good in any case i do nt think that the producers or ron howard were expecting this movie to be a major hit they probably expected better  or they probably would nt have gone ahead with the project  but i m glad that they did we need something for people who do nt go in for costumed superheroes ,d014nyw,movies,entertainment,1455572997.0,epepepturbo,1.0,0.0,8407,15091,0.0

664,so hear me out here  everyone assumes that days of future past retconned wade wilson from xmen origins and turned him into the wade wilson from deadpool the problem with this is that the past portions of dofp take place in 1973  while the scene with team x in xmen origins takes place in 1979 the wade wilson from xmen origins would have already been born sometime in the 1950 s  maybe even late 40 s   while the wade wilson from deadpool was nt born until sometime in the 80 s  or late 70 s   my headcanon is that the original wade wilson probably abandoned deadpool  gave him up for adoption  or simply passed away while acting as a mercenary i understand that many will think that i m taking details from  deadpool  too seriously  but i think it s fun to think about it  especially when  i love having an overview over the xmen cinematic universe   https  wwwredditcomrmoviescomments26vlqlxmen_visual_timeline_oc   tl  dr  wade wilson from deadpool is possibly the son of an alternate version of the wade wilson from xmen origins  wolverine ,4660c5,movies,entertainment,1455675804.0,mmmasian,2.0,0.0,10311,8130,0.0

697,he s not wrong  the problem is that what made  deadpool  a good movie is nt always easily replicated  and hollywood is first and foremost a business that wants to replicate success oftentimes  what makes a thing successful depends heavily on the zeitgeist  think of how many movies we call  underappreciated gems  while we marvel that sony greenlit  pixels   obviously  someone  somewhere  thought that  pixels  was going to generate money and why not  it has a bigbudget star  adam sandler   a topic we all find endearing  classic video games   upandcoming stars  josh gad  and an immensely popular actor  peter dinklage   happy madison has also produced some startlingly popular  bad  movies  happy gilmore and billy madison are charming pieces of shit  to put it bluntly  but we love them because on some level they re aware of their shittiness   why  should nt  that be successful  on paper  when making a marketing pitch  that all sounds good throw a few million at it  let sandler phone in a goofball performance  and step back to count money as hookers bring you all the cocaine  right  wrong  because the hollywood financial analysis is not built to consider that merely capturing buzzwords and things that are popular fails to account for the specific historicocultural context that made them popular in the first place in less academic terms  it ignores the  heart  of why we like certain things in favor of the flash and style of the things we like ,d0198fz,movies,entertainment,1455580033.0,ccmulligan,9.0,0.0,781,86163,0.0

1194,this was a downright terrific movie  if you re a fan of westerns  it s an absolute must i d say it s more western than horror  but if i was to make a comparison to a horror it s closest in spirit to takashi miike s audition  it s a slow burn in the absolute best possible way  it s paced like a dying wheeze  anticipation stretched out to feelings of suffocating  and gives us plenty of time to get to know the rather exceptionally well written characters while ramping up the sense of hopelessness and dread richard jenkins is particularly fantastic  and i practically did nt recognise matthew fox at first kurt russell is on even better form than he was in hateful eight  his subdued and somber sherriff here is a far cry from his bombastic bounty hunter in tarantino s movie  see this movie it s hands down one of the best modern westerns i ve seen  and considering the exceptional company it s in  that s no small feat ,d02gt84,movies,entertainment,1455662057.0,Casey234,52.0,0.0,4531,40974,0.0

1209,when i was a kid  the first alien film i watched was aliens and it did nt stop me from understanding and enjoying the film however  it did leave me with questions which were only answered when i saw the original  so basically  i think one can start with aliens however  i feel alien is a better movie the problem with the sequel  however  is that the first one established that the xenomorphs were practically unkillable creatures in aliens they re suddenly canon fodder  so with that in mind  aliens undermines the danger of the xenomorphs  rendering the xeno in the first film less menacing so it may ruin the first film if you watch the second first  not to mention  it ruins the first film because the second films mentions how the first films ends everyone dies except ripley even the twist is explained  where she blows up the ship but the alien happens to be in the escape pod  and ripley blows it out of the airlock total spoilers of a great movie here ,d02l4yo,movies,entertainment,1455668735.0,MartelFirst,5.0,0.0,7408,133914,0.0

1219,maybe this means bumblebee will finally get a voice box in t5 and if it s lower budget that means less boring explosions and they might service the story i do nt know a lot about bumblebee  but this could potentially draw from source material and make a good movie that might be more acceptable by long time fans i do nt claim to be a long time fan of the franchise from back when they were toys  i just like the films for my action fix and do nt expect much else also the transformers transforming is so satisfying to watch  there s a lot of wishful thinking on my part  but even though i ll go to see it anyway  i get the feeling that because it s lower budget it wo nt be overproduced and will be handled more deftly i m hopeful for the sake of others finding enjoyment from these films again  the scrotum joke from t2 has soured a lot of people i know the even numbered ones are much better  t1 and t3 are good watching  all you need to know from t2 is optimus dies  comes back and beats generic bad guy and wounds megatron dark of the moon feels like a proper sequel to t1 anyway  the story is better and the action is only where it should be the final battle is also pretty amazing ,d024ncu,movies,entertainment,1455645715.0,Oh_I_still_here,5.0,0.0,1,8348,0.0

1463,i actually really enjoyed the film but while i think i m pretty much on the same page as moore politically  i think his film making suffers from severe bias and  even worse  a lack of much real insight the extra hopefulness this film had made the film much more enjoyable  but unfortunately the film raises more questions that it even tries to answer  so i was curious if anybody has come across any articles of people rebutting the ideas that moore proposes  or explaining about the negative sideeffects that these countries deal with that were overlooked in the film   i just like to balance out documentaries with a contrary perspective  even if i agree with what s being proposed  edit  for the record  i know his films are flawed and that the usa is much larger than many other countries i was mostly curious if people think he s looking at these foreign programs through rosetinted glasses  in respect to their native country  and if so how a better example that i did nt use above  the norwegian  i think  prison system seems absolutely absurd to me but they boast a much lower murder rate it s hard for me to wrap my head around i do nt think it s feasible for the usa to convert to this system tomorrow i m still curious about it though ,464ocx,movies,entertainment,1455657832.0,nomefish,7.0,0.0,6466,7952,0.0

2346,there is a pattern set by the two trilogies i think this new one will conform to it     phantom menace   and   a new hope   there s a connotation that something has begun or has yet to reach its potential  it ll brew and build up   the force awakens   definitely follows this   then you have   empire strikes back   and   attack of the clones    both titles declare an aggressive action this is when everything kicks off   of course we end with resolution in the words   return   and   revenge    notice also that the prequel s titles are the inverse of the original trilogies a new hope refers to luke the good guy  and then phantom menace to palpatine  i think    then empire clones  the clones were the good guys  and sithjedi this is probably obvious to everybody on earth but i just noticed  episode viii will probably follow the precedent set by the the second installments of the previous trilogies as i ve outlined but there are only so many synonyms for attack and strike also  the episodes were named by lucas and since he s out of the picture  they may do something different this time around  just based on episode 7 s title though  i think there s a good chance they ll repeat it  my title would be    fury of the order   of course i hope the filmmakers come up with something better ,d01roxb,movies,entertainment,1455619693.0,rod_munch,63.0,0.0,29172,40763,0.0
