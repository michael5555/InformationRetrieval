21,22,make sure to switch your dryer circuit on your fuse box to off and unplug the dryer  open the door to your dryer and you should see two screws on the upper corners of door recess on the front panel  this will allow you to lift off and remove the top panel of the dryer  now you will see one screw in each of the upper inside edges of the dryers front panel  remove those and the front panel will be free put this forward and it will release itself from the drum of the dryer  the lip that the dryer drum was resting on is where you will see the dryer bearings they are plastic  same as the nalgene bottle  or teflon tabs that are about 1cmx6cm in size with a hole on the right side and both ends tucked into the plastic housing if your dryer is squeaky  one or more of these bearings are worn through and you have metal on metal contact  hence the squeaking    here is a picture of where the dryer bearings are located   http  imgurcomgalleryej3fo96   here is a picture of what the bearings look like   http  imgurcomscerexx  take your nalgene bottle  the old milky white ones with the blue lid  not the newer hard shatterproof ones  and use some heavy scissors to cut a strip of the bottle that is wide enough that it will just barely fit into the slots on the lip where the bearings go drill or puncture a hole in the strip so that both sides tuck into the slots and the hole catches the little prong repeat with all worn bearings  now you can stick your hand into the inside of the dryer barrel and lift the front end back onto the lip where the bearings are and close the dryer in the reverse of the order you took it apart  enjoy dry clothes without the horrible squeaking  also  if the lip where the bearings are located is broken to the point where you can not install new bearings  you can order a new bearing unit online for a few bucks and extend the life of your dryer  cheers ,45v5wk,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455517063.0,docshultz,3.0,0.0,159,7958,0.0

recently  i didn  t have a productivity system i didn  t really need one  there was always work that needed doing  and i had various side projects to fill out the time i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another  but  letting my tasklist run the day had downsides work expanded to fill the amount of time i had  meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity also  those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren  t going anywhere  my tasklist dictated my time  but in a haphazard  thoughtless way when i had something in front of me  especially with a deadline  i attacked it but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve i was great at bottomsup execution  but not so great at topdown management  then i returned to consulting  and with it  multiple clients  complex projects and numerous deliverables  i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects the  flow  wouldn  t do i needed a system    tl  dr  the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist  project tracker and calendar into one entity every night  i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects  and i schedule them to available timeslots completed tasks are checked off and disappear  those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session i try and fill in the entire day with appointments  even if they  re just  go for a walk  or  travel to client    it works because scheduled things get done   the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful  sustained progress on larger projects i  m much better at prioritizing  because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours  the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well it  s like eating healthy if you  try to eat healthier  from whatever  s in front of you  you won  t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep one is aspiration  the other is a plan  the scheduling discipline works even when i don  t follow the actual schedule  which is nearly 100  of the time scheduling merely sets the goalpost going off track doesn  t change the fact that i  ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it  which is the real struggle  here  s how i do it    tools  note  this is obviously for a mac setup i  m sure you can find analogs for pcandroid  i just don  t know what they are   fantastical 2  desktop and iphone apps the os x calendar on steroids has a lot of nice features  but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar   iphone with siri and reminders my system works only if it  s supereasy to enter new appointments and reminders   icloud account  for easy syncing between everything     the process 1 throughout the day  i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2   remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning    i always schedule tasks for a general time like  tomorrow afternoon  or  friday morning   it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling  2 each night  i review and schedule tasks this 1015 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day first  i pull up the calendar in fantastical  and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot  to be handled in sequence  while a longer project will get its own slot  3 in that same nightly review  i schedule the day  s activities i use one primary account  icloud calendar  and put blocks down for projects  workouts  transit time  prep time for appointments  phone calls  meditation  meals and whatever else i want to accomplish  4 during the day  i stick to the calendar when possible i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for  5 but i don  t worry if the schedule gets blown up sometimes i get taken off track by something important other days  i  m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to  and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency it  s like eating pizza after a hard training session  discipline earns you guiltfree slacking that night  i honestly account for what i did and didn  t do  and push things back accordingly    an example here  s a heavily simplified use case a client has given me a project with two discrete items  a task to check in with someone  and a hour of actual work to do   click here to see diagram   http  iimgurcomzbgntfppng    the benefits    doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain   an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it prioritizing tasks  estimating timelabor and thinking about when to do each item batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work  better followthrough on tasks scheduling things improves the chance they  ll get done  period  even if i don  t actually do them on the schedule it seems nutty to schedule meditation  for instance  but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in     free time is anticipated and used   i used to stumble over pockets of free time  and when i found them  i didn  t know what to do with myself now  i fill wideopen spaces with productive uses of energy     planning around my natural energy levels   i can block out time for big projects in the morning  schedule email replies after lunch  and generally anticipate what i  ll be best at     better prepped and more polished   scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents  talking points and questions even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one    important caveats    this is not about being a robot   the schedule is a guide  not strict  i prepare it as though i  ll stick to it  but i rarely stay 50  on track think of it this way  my natural productivity is about a c with this system  i plan for an a  and in executing wind up around a bb     this is not about  manager  s schedule     my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon     this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day   i actually relax more now  because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks  cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm  and leave weekends completely clear    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider

217,218,my dad used to work for a vending machine company  and as a little kid  i got to tag along every once in a while when i had no school  whether intentional or not     i got soda and snacks all day long  to my heart s content after all  chips  sodas  etc come in huge boxes  and one missing is not gon na warrant some sort of scandal  i think my dad s boss expected his workers to have one every once in a while  i mean  who would nt   always an awesome little joyride  as long as i brought my gameboy along for the boring and sometimes long rides between stops  anyways  over time  there was a little trick i learned with the machines  particularly drinks machines if you ve ever look inside one  you ll realize that there are something like 1012 soda columns where the cans lie flat  with like 3 cans per row  just like  this   https  eddieleephotographyfileswordpresscom201302insidecokemachinejpg   on certain machines  however  there are sometimes as little as 7 or 8 buttons for rows my little kid brain realized this discrepancy  paid attention  and noticed some things  these are the older machines you ll spot one of these standard  machines by the locking mechanism it uses a  circular key lock   http  wwwpadlocks4lesscommediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95memei2400as_left_tilt_keysjpg  that pops out a lever the lever unscrews  and the fridge doors open yes  doors there are two the first doorpanel with the light bars  electronics  money counting and receiving mechanism  and then a well insulated door to keep the soda cool and separate from the electronic computer back to the first panel  behind the panel door is the mechanism that counts exact amounts of money entered  exact amounts of sodas or snacks dispensed  total sales  etc my dad recorded it all on a clipboard with serial numbers  and if there was ever a sort of problem  a technician would be sent to the machine to check it out  but here s the thing my little 89 year old brain carefully noticed something particular and like i said  if you never looked inside these machines  you d never know there were sometimes more columns of soda than buttons here s where you can hack the machine  it s a sort of careful progress  so if it does nt happen the first time  you can try again sometimes  there s no way of knowing 100  if it worked  but i ve noticed that it s common with those older machines look for a machine that prices their sodas at a little bit more than a dollar  say   125 now get a dollar  and put it in just a dollar and press your soda it will try to register as a sale  but because you do nt have enough  it will not dispense the soda get change the computer now registered a failed attempt  but nothing else take the same dollar  and try the next soda once again  another nonregistered fail attempt at purchase  no dispensed soda take your change again try it once each with all the buttons you ve gone through the first 8 or so columns of soda   but not the last few ones  go and get the extra money you need to purchase a regular priced  soda from one of the buttons in this case  you would deposit  125 now that the transaction  is open  hit the soda you want now  like i said  it might not work out the first time  after all  there s no way of looking inside the machine without the key   if it does nt work out  try it again but if you did everything the way i wrote it out and it worked fine  you will have gotten a soda  not from one of the main columns  but one of the extra reserve columns walk away  open that sumbitch up  and enjoy it you just got an extra reserves  soda  tl  dr neat little trick to get a soda that is not visibly registered for purchase on a machine if all else fails  just ask the damn soda machine guy about the money it ate up about 910 times  he ll just give you a free soda to get you off his back so he can finish his job for him  it s the most trivial part of getting back to the warehouse and clocking out for the weekend  edit  a word,czp1bb9,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454694465.0,Liquid_Vine,9.0,0.0,163,1142,0.0

235,236,pest control technician here  first thing you are going to do is make sure your roof is sealed and that there are no branches from trees hanging over your house rats and squirrels will use those to get onto your roof  you re going to want to check your roof for any and all kind of entrances your exhaust vents should all have screens if your attic has a vent or a fan  it needs a screen check the corners  underneath eaves  where the roof may meet and create a pocket with another section of roof you re looking mainly for holes or crevices they could scurry into  remember  if the hole is only as big as their head  they can fit  the best way to identify if rats are using an area to get in and out of the house is to look for brown stains they piss uncontrollably and it leaves a dark brown and sometimes black  run  alone the base of their entrance ways google will be your friend when needing image examples for this  next you are going to want to check your decks if you have any underneath is where they like to chew holes into your house you re going to have to seal it up with chain or lattice work if you want to keep them out for good  now  it s time for trapping you re going to want to place your traps in areas that the rats are going to start searching for food it s tricky  but a few google searches should set you in the right direction i  unfortunately  would need to see your house to know exactly where to put the traps  but you need to know this  putting traps out when the house is still exposed to entrances and exits will be a waste of time sealing the house cuts off their food  which means they will start searching within the house and be desperate for whatever is on the trap  good luck to you if you need any more info just shoot me a message  edit  spelling,czudxg0,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455077228.0,StormrayVoice,1.0,0.0,957,231,0.0

8561,8562,i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo s bouncing around in my head i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time  and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively  enter the scheduling system i ve been using this method for the last few months  and it has rocked my world i m getting more stuff done  and more importantly  planning for free time and using it constructively the best part is that it s very simple    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up i write about nobs strategies to improve your daily hustle  http  hackthegrindnetsubscribe     scheduling the day  a productivity method for entrepreneurs  until recently  i didn  t have a productivity system i didn  t really need one  there was always work that needed doing  and i had various side projects to fill out the time i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another  but  letting my tasklist run the day had downsides work expanded to fill the amount of time i had  meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity also  those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren  t going anywhere  my tasklist dictated my time  but in a haphazard  thoughtless way when i had something in front of me  especially with a deadline  i attacked it but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve i was great at bottomsup execution  but not so great at topdown management  then i returned to consulting  and with it  multiple clients  complex projects and numerous deliverables  i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects the  flow  wouldn  t do i needed a system    tl  dr  the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist  project tracker and calendar into one entity every night  i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects  and i schedule them to available timeslots completed tasks are checked off and disappear  those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session i try and fill in the entire day with appointments  even if they  re just  go for a walk  or  travel to client    it works because scheduled things get done   the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful  sustained progress on larger projects i  m much better at prioritizing  because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours  the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well it  s like eating healthy if you  try to eat healthier  from whatever  s in front of you  you won  t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep one is aspiration  the other is a plan  the scheduling discipline works even when i don  t follow the actual schedule  which is nearly 100  of the time scheduling merely sets the goalpost going off track doesn  t change the fact that i  ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it  which is the real struggle  here  s how i do it    tools  note  this is obviously for a mac setup i  m sure you can find analogs for pcandroid  i just don  t know what they are   fantastical 2  desktop and iphone apps the os x calendar on steroids has a lot of nice features  but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar   iphone with siri and reminders my system works only if it  s supereasy to enter new appointments and reminders   icloud account  for easy syncing between everything     the process 1 throughout the day  i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2   remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning    i always schedule tasks for a general time like  tomorrow afternoon  or  friday morning   it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling  2 each night  i review and schedule tasks this 1015 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day first  i pull up the calendar in fantastical  and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot  to be handled in sequence  while a longer project will get its own slot  3 in that same nightly review  i schedule the day  s activities i use one primary account  icloud calendar  and put blocks down for projects  workouts  transit time  prep time for appointments  phone calls  meditation  meals and whatever else i want to accomplish  4 during the day  i stick to the calendar when possible i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for  5 but i don  t worry if the schedule gets blown up sometimes i get taken off track by something important other days  i  m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to  and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency it  s like eating pizza after a hard training session  discipline earns you guiltfree slacking that night  i honestly account for what i did and didn  t do  and push things back accordingly    an example here  s a heavily simplified use case a client has given me a project with two discrete items  a task to check in with someone  and a hour of actual work to do   click here to see diagram   http  iimgurcomzbgntfppng    the benefits    doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain   an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it prioritizing tasks  estimating timelabor and thinking about when to do each item batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work  better followthrough on tasks scheduling things improves the chance they  ll get done  period  even if i don  t actually do them on the schedule it seems nutty to schedule meditation  for instance  but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in     free time is anticipated and used   i used to stumble over pockets of free time  and when i found them  i didn  t know what to do with myself now  i fill wideopen spaces with productive uses of energy     planning around my natural energy levels   i can block out time for big projects in the morning  schedule email replies after lunch  and generally anticipate what i  ll be best at     better prepped and more polished   scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents  talking points and questions even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one    important caveats    this is not about being a robot   the schedule is a guide  not strict  i prepare it as though i  ll stick to it  but i rarely stay 50  on track think of it this way  my natural productivity is about a c with this system  i plan for an a  and in executing wind up around a bb     this is not about  manager  s schedule     my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon     this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day   i actually relax more now  because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks  cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm  and leave weekends completely clear    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider

11053,11054,my dad used to work for a vending machine company  and as a little kid  i got to tag along every once in a while when i had no school  whether intentional or not     i got soda and snacks all day long  to my heart s content after all  chips  sodas  etc come in huge boxes  and one missing is not gon na warrant some sort of scandal  i think my dad s boss expected his workers to have one every once in a while  i mean  who would nt   always an awesome little joyride  as long as i brought my gameboy along for the boring and sometimes long rides between stops  anyways  over time  there was a little trick i learned with the machines  particularly drinks machines if you ve ever look inside one  you ll realize that there are something like 1012 soda columns where the cans lie flat  with like 3 cans per row  just like  this   https  eddieleephotographyfileswordpresscom201302insidecokemachinejpg   on certain machines  however  there are sometimes as little as 7 or 8 buttons for rows my little kid brain realized this discrepancy  paid attention  and noticed some things  these are the older machines you ll spot one of these standard  machines by the locking mechanism it uses a  circular key lock   http  wwwpadlocks4lesscommediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95memei2400as_left_tilt_keysjpg  that pops out a lever the lever unscrews  and the fridge doors open yes  doors there are two the first doorpanel with the light bars  electronics  money counting and receiving mechanism  and then a well insulated door to keep the soda cool and separate from the electronic computer back to the first panel  behind the panel door is the mechanism that counts exact amounts of money entered  exact amounts of sodas or snacks dispensed  total sales  etc my dad recorded it all on a clipboard with serial numbers  and if there was ever a sort of problem  a technician would be sent to the machine to check it out  but here s the thing my little 89 year old brain carefully noticed something particular and like i said  if you never looked inside these machines  you d never know there were sometimes more columns of soda than buttons here s where you can hack the machine  it s a sort of careful progress  so if it does nt happen the first time  you can try again sometimes  there s no way of knowing 100  if it worked  but i ve noticed that it s common with those older machines look for a machine that prices their sodas at a little bit more than a dollar  say   125 now get a dollar  and put it in just a dollar and press your soda it will try to register as a sale  but because you do nt have enough  it will not dispense the soda get change the computer now registered a failed attempt  but nothing else take the same dollar  and try the next soda once again  another nonregistered fail attempt at purchase  no dispensed soda take your change again try it once each with all the buttons you ve gone through the first 8 or so columns of soda   but not the last few ones  go and get the extra money you need to purchase a regular priced  soda from one of the buttons in this case  you would deposit  125 now that the transaction  is open  hit the soda you want now  like i said  it might not work out the first time  after all  there s no way of looking inside the machine without the key   if it does nt work out  try it again but if you did everything the way i wrote it out and it worked fine  you will have gotten a soda  not from one of the main columns  but one of the extra reserve columns walk away  open that sumbitch up  and enjoy it you just got an extra reserves  soda  tl  dr neat little trick to get a soda that is not visibly registered for purchase on a machine if all else fails  just ask the damn soda machine guy about the money it ate up about 910 times  he ll just give you a free soda to get you off his back so he can finish his job for him  it s the most trivial part of getting back to the warehouse and clocking out for the weekend  edit  a word,czp1bb9,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454694465.0,Liquid_Vine,7.0,0.0,163,1142,0.0

21610,21611,i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo s bouncing around in my head i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time  and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively  enter the scheduling system i ve been using this method for the last few months  and it has rocked my world i m getting more stuff done  and more importantly  planning for free time and using it constructively the best part is that it s very simple    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up i write about nobs strategies to improve your daily hustle  http  hackthegrindnetsubscribe     scheduling the day  a productivity method for entrepreneurs  until recently  i didn  t have a productivity system i didn  t really need one  there was always work that needed doing  and i had various side projects to fill out the time i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another  but  letting my tasklist run the day had downsides work expanded to fill the amount of time i had  meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity also  those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren  t going anywhere  my tasklist dictated my time  but in a haphazard  thoughtless way when i had something in front of me  especially with a deadline  i attacked it but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve i was great at bottomsup execution  but not so great at topdown management  then i returned to consulting  and with it  multiple clients  complex projects and numerous deliverables  i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects the  flow  wouldn  t do i needed a system    tl  dr  the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist  project tracker and calendar into one entity every night  i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects  and i schedule them to available timeslots completed tasks are checked off and disappear  those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session i try and fill in the entire day with appointments  even if they  re just  go for a walk  or  travel to client    it works because scheduled things get done   the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful  sustained progress on larger projects i  m much better at prioritizing  because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours  the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well it  s like eating healthy if you  try to eat healthier  from whatever  s in front of you  you won  t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep one is aspiration  the other is a plan  the scheduling discipline works even when i don  t follow the actual schedule  which is nearly 100  of the time scheduling merely sets the goalpost going off track doesn  t change the fact that i  ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it  which is the real struggle  here  s how i do it    tools  note  this is obviously for a mac setup i  m sure you can find analogs for pcandroid  i just don  t know what they are   fantastical 2  desktop and iphone apps the os x calendar on steroids has a lot of nice features  but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar   iphone with siri and reminders my system works only if it  s supereasy to enter new appointments and reminders   icloud account  for easy syncing between everything     the process 1 throughout the day  i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2   remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning    i always schedule tasks for a general time like  tomorrow afternoon  or  friday morning   it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling  2 each night  i review and schedule tasks this 1015 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day first  i pull up the calendar in fantastical  and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot  to be handled in sequence  while a longer project will get its own slot  3 in that same nightly review  i schedule the day  s activities i use one primary account  icloud calendar  and put blocks down for projects  workouts  transit time  prep time for appointments  phone calls  meditation  meals and whatever else i want to accomplish  4 during the day  i stick to the calendar when possible i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for  5 but i don  t worry if the schedule gets blown up sometimes i get taken off track by something important other days  i  m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to  and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency it  s like eating pizza after a hard training session  discipline earns you guiltfree slacking that night  i honestly account for what i did and didn  t do  and push things back accordingly    an example here  s a heavily simplified use case a client has given me a project with two discrete items  a task to check in with someone  and a hour of actual work to do   click here to see diagram   http  iimgurcomzbgntfppng    the benefits    doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain   an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it prioritizing tasks  estimating timelabor and thinking about when to do each item batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work  better followthrough on tasks scheduling things improves the chance they  ll get done  period  even if i don  t actually do them on the schedule it seems nutty to schedule meditation  for instance  but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in     free time is anticipated and used   i used to stumble over pockets of free time  and when i found them  i didn  t know what to do with myself now  i fill wideopen spaces with productive uses of energy     planning around my natural energy levels   i can block out time for big projects in the morning  schedule email replies after lunch  and generally anticipate what i  ll be best at     better prepped and more polished   scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents  talking points and questions even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one    important caveats    this is not about being a robot   the schedule is a guide  not strict  i prepare it as though i  ll stick to it  but i rarely stay 50  on track think of it this way  my natural productivity is about a c with this system  i plan for an a  and in executing wind up around a bb     this is not about  manager  s schedule     my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon     this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day   i actually relax more now  because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks  cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm  and leave weekends completely clear    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider

21645,21646,my dad used to work for a vending machine company  and as a little kid  i got to tag along every once in a while when i had no school  whether intentional or not     i got soda and snacks all day long  to my heart s content after all  chips  sodas  etc come in huge boxes  and one missing is not gon na warrant some sort of scandal  i think my dad s boss expected his workers to have one every once in a while  i mean  who would nt   always an awesome little joyride  as long as i brought my gameboy along for the boring and sometimes long rides between stops  anyways  over time  there was a little trick i learned with the machines  particularly drinks machines if you ve ever look inside one  you ll realize that there are something like 1012 soda columns where the cans lie flat  with like 3 cans per row  just like  this   https  eddieleephotographyfileswordpresscom201302insidecokemachinejpg   on certain machines  however  there are sometimes as little as 7 or 8 buttons for rows my little kid brain realized this discrepancy  paid attention  and noticed some things  these are the older machines you ll spot one of these standard  machines by the locking mechanism it uses a  circular key lock   http  wwwpadlocks4lesscommediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95memei2400as_left_tilt_keysjpg  that pops out a lever the lever unscrews  and the fridge doors open yes  doors there are two the first doorpanel with the light bars  electronics  money counting and receiving mechanism  and then a well insulated door to keep the soda cool and separate from the electronic computer back to the first panel  behind the panel door is the mechanism that counts exact amounts of money entered  exact amounts of sodas or snacks dispensed  total sales  etc my dad recorded it all on a clipboard with serial numbers  and if there was ever a sort of problem  a technician would be sent to the machine to check it out  but here s the thing my little 89 year old brain carefully noticed something particular and like i said  if you never looked inside these machines  you d never know there were sometimes more columns of soda than buttons here s where you can hack the machine  it s a sort of careful progress  so if it does nt happen the first time  you can try again sometimes  there s no way of knowing 100  if it worked  but i ve noticed that it s common with those older machines look for a machine that prices their sodas at a little bit more than a dollar  say   125 now get a dollar  and put it in just a dollar and press your soda it will try to register as a sale  but because you do nt have enough  it will not dispense the soda get change the computer now registered a failed attempt  but nothing else take the same dollar  and try the next soda once again  another nonregistered fail attempt at purchase  no dispensed soda take your change again try it once each with all the buttons you ve gone through the first 8 or so columns of soda   but not the last few ones  go and get the extra money you need to purchase a regular priced  soda from one of the buttons in this case  you would deposit  125 now that the transaction  is open  hit the soda you want now  like i said  it might not work out the first time  after all  there s no way of looking inside the machine without the key   if it does nt work out  try it again but if you did everything the way i wrote it out and it worked fine  you will have gotten a soda  not from one of the main columns  but one of the extra reserve columns walk away  open that sumbitch up  and enjoy it you just got an extra reserves  soda  tl  dr neat little trick to get a soda that is not visibly registered for purchase on a machine if all else fails  just ask the damn soda machine guy about the money it ate up about 910 times  he ll just give you a free soda to get you off his back so he can finish his job for him  it s the most trivial part of getting back to the warehouse and clocking out for the weekend  edit  a word,czp1bb9,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454694465.0,Liquid_Vine,8.0,0.0,163,1142,0.0

35995,35996,i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo s bouncing around in my head i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time  and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively  enter the scheduling system i ve been using this method for the last few months  and it has rocked my world i m getting more stuff done  and more importantly  planning for free time and using it constructively the best part is that it s very simple    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up i write about nobs strategies to improve your daily hustle  http  hackthegrindnetsubscribe     scheduling the day  a productivity method for entrepreneurs  until recently  i didn  t have a productivity system i didn  t really need one  there was always work that needed doing  and i had various side projects to fill out the time i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another  but  letting my tasklist run the day had downsides work expanded to fill the amount of time i had  meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity also  those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren  t going anywhere  my tasklist dictated my time  but in a haphazard  thoughtless way when i had something in front of me  especially with a deadline  i attacked it but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve i was great at bottomsup execution  but not so great at topdown management  then i returned to consulting  and with it  multiple clients  complex projects and numerous deliverables  i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects the  flow  wouldn  t do i needed a system    tl  dr  the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist  project tracker and calendar into one entity every night  i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects  and i schedule them to available timeslots completed tasks are checked off and disappear  those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session i try and fill in the entire day with appointments  even if they  re just  go for a walk  or  travel to client    it works because scheduled things get done   the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful  sustained progress on larger projects i  m much better at prioritizing  because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours  the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well it  s like eating healthy if you  try to eat healthier  from whatever  s in front of you  you won  t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep one is aspiration  the other is a plan  the scheduling discipline works even when i don  t follow the actual schedule  which is nearly 100  of the time scheduling merely sets the goalpost going off track doesn  t change the fact that i  ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it  which is the real struggle  here  s how i do it    tools  note  this is obviously for a mac setup i  m sure you can find analogs for pcandroid  i just don  t know what they are   fantastical 2  desktop and iphone apps the os x calendar on steroids has a lot of nice features  but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar   iphone with siri and reminders my system works only if it  s supereasy to enter new appointments and reminders   icloud account  for easy syncing between everything     the process 1 throughout the day  i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2   remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning    i always schedule tasks for a general time like  tomorrow afternoon  or  friday morning   it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling  2 each night  i review and schedule tasks this 1015 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day first  i pull up the calendar in fantastical  and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot  to be handled in sequence  while a longer project will get its own slot  3 in that same nightly review  i schedule the day  s activities i use one primary account  icloud calendar  and put blocks down for projects  workouts  transit time  prep time for appointments  phone calls  meditation  meals and whatever else i want to accomplish  4 during the day  i stick to the calendar when possible i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for  5 but i don  t worry if the schedule gets blown up sometimes i get taken off track by something important other days  i  m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to  and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency it  s like eating pizza after a hard training session  discipline earns you guiltfree slacking that night  i honestly account for what i did and didn  t do  and push things back accordingly    an example here  s a heavily simplified use case a client has given me a project with two discrete items  a task to check in with someone  and a hour of actual work to do   click here to see diagram   http  iimgurcomzbgntfppng    the benefits    doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain   an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it prioritizing tasks  estimating timelabor and thinking about when to do each item batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work  better followthrough on tasks scheduling things improves the chance they  ll get done  period  even if i don  t actually do them on the schedule it seems nutty to schedule meditation  for instance  but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in     free time is anticipated and used   i used to stumble over pockets of free time  and when i found them  i didn  t know what to do with myself now  i fill wideopen spaces with productive uses of energy     planning around my natural energy levels   i can block out time for big projects in the morning  schedule email replies after lunch  and generally anticipate what i  ll be best at     better prepped and more polished   scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents  talking points and questions even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one    important caveats    this is not about being a robot   the schedule is a guide  not strict  i prepare it as though i  ll stick to it  but i rarely stay 50  on track think of it this way  my natural productivity is about a c with this system  i plan for an a  and in executing wind up around a bb     this is not about  manager  s schedule     my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon     this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day   i actually relax more now  because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks  cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm  and leave weekends completely clear    if you find stuff like this helpful  please consider

38729,38730,my dad used to work for a vending machine company  and as a little kid  i got to tag along every once in a while when i had no school  whether intentional or not     i got soda and snacks all day long  to my heart s content after all  chips  sodas  etc come in huge boxes  and one missing is not gon na warrant some sort of scandal  i think my dad s boss expected his workers to have one every once in a while  i mean  who would nt   always an awesome little joyride  as long as i brought my gameboy along for the boring and sometimes long rides between stops  anyways  over time  there was a little trick i learned with the machines  particularly drinks machines if you ve ever look inside one  you ll realize that there are something like 1012 soda columns where the cans lie flat  with like 3 cans per row  just like  this   https  eddieleephotographyfileswordpresscom201302insidecokemachinejpg   on certain machines  however  there are sometimes as little as 7 or 8 buttons for rows my little kid brain realized this discrepancy  paid attention  and noticed some things  these are the older machines you ll spot one of these standard  machines by the locking mechanism it uses a  circular key lock   http  wwwpadlocks4lesscommediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95memei2400as_left_tilt_keysjpg  that pops out a lever the lever unscrews  and the fridge doors open yes  doors there are two the first doorpanel with the light bars  electronics  money counting and receiving mechanism  and then a well insulated door to keep the soda cool and separate from the electronic computer back to the first panel  behind the panel door is the mechanism that counts exact amounts of money entered  exact amounts of sodas or snacks dispensed  total sales  etc my dad recorded it all on a clipboard with serial numbers  and if there was ever a sort of problem  a technician would be sent to the machine to check it out  but here s the thing my little 89 year old brain carefully noticed something particular and like i said  if you never looked inside these machines  you d never know there were sometimes more columns of soda than buttons here s where you can hack the machine  it s a sort of careful progress  so if it does nt happen the first time  you can try again sometimes  there s no way of knowing 100  if it worked  but i ve noticed that it s common with those older machines look for a machine that prices their sodas at a little bit more than a dollar  say   125 now get a dollar  and put it in just a dollar and press your soda it will try to register as a sale  but because you do nt have enough  it will not dispense the soda get change the computer now registered a failed attempt  but nothing else take the same dollar  and try the next soda once again  another nonregistered fail attempt at purchase  no dispensed soda take your change again try it once each with all the buttons you ve gone through the first 8 or so columns of soda   but not the last few ones  go and get the extra money you need to purchase a regular priced  soda from one of the buttons in this case  you would deposit  125 now that the transaction  is open  hit the soda you want now  like i said  it might not work out the first time  after all  there s no way of looking inside the machine without the key   if it does nt work out  try it again but if you did everything the way i wrote it out and it worked fine  you will have gotten a soda  not from one of the main columns  but one of the extra reserve columns walk away  open that sumbitch up  and enjoy it you just got an extra reserves  soda  tl  dr neat little trick to get a soda that is not visibly registered for purchase on a machine if all else fails  just ask the damn soda machine guy about the money it ate up about 910 times  he ll just give you a free soda to get you off his back so he can finish his job for him  it s the most trivial part of getting back to the warehouse and clocking out for the weekend  edit  a word,czp1bb9,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454694465.0,Liquid_Vine,10.0,0.0,163,1142,0.0
