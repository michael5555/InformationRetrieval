23,explanation of the   7   rule  since it took me a minute to understand  your number  say  889  is split into 10x  y  or 880  9   we want to know if 10x  y divides by 7     so we multiply by 5   10x  y   5  50x  5y  multiplying a number by 5 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume m and n are integers a number   7m  n    where n is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  multiplies by 5 to become   35m  5n    dividing evenly by 7 must remove the 35m  leaving 5n 5n will not divide by 7 unless n  is  7  therefore if   7m  n   is not divisible by 7  neither is the product of it and 5     we then subtract 49x  which is   always   divisible by 7  and 7y  which is also   always   divisible by 7    50x  5y    49x  7y   x  2y  subtracting a multiple of 7 does nt affect whether it is divisible by 7  example  assume p  q  and r are integers a number   7p  r    where r is the remainder when the number is divided evenly by 7  subtracts some value   7q    the difference remaining is 7p  7q  r  or   7  pq   r    because p and q are integers  pq must also be an integer  meaning 7  pq  is a multiple of 7 the remainder when 7  pq   r is therefore r as with the original number  meaning if   7p  r   is not divisible by 7  neither is the difference between it and a number that  is  divisible by 7     therefore  to see if a number of the form 10x  y    88   0    9    is divisible by 7  we may test x  2y    88      18    instead  hope this was helpful      ps this method is way easier than the godawful  1024  method  or however it worked   plus  this one chains    889  7   8818   7  70  7   70   7  7  7 ,cywfe4w,youshouldknow,learning,1452673203.0,ricdesi,1.0,0.0,2174,19864,0.0

303,  tl  dr  you should probably be using bitdefender   hello  professional tech guy here i run a business where a big part of my job is doing virus removals  fixingremoving   norton and mcafee   malfunctioning antivirus  and securing systems when clean i ve been doing it for a long time and i m very good at what i do given the recent  avast controversy   https  supportmozillaorgenusquestions1028987  i d like to clear some some very outdated misconceptions and give some up to date advice as to what you should be doing to protect your pc without spending a bunch of money on software licensing my opinions will be opinions and my facts will be sourced  the major misconception that i want to clear up is the one that microsoft security essentialswindows defender  mse from here on out  is a good antivirus or even a good enough antivirus solution based on tests from the two leading independent antivirus benchmark companies mse barely qualifies as antivirus at all it consistently rates at or near the bottom in terms of protection from not only zeroday attacks  which is what you really want your av to protect against  but also wellknown malware that has been in the wild for a while  here are the basic ratings from avtestorg for mse protection   date  os  rating6           february 2014   https

wwwavtestorgenantivirushomewindowswindows10october2015microsoftwindowsdefender48153747   win 10  35  if you look at the actual detections rates you can see they go as high as 999  in some tests the problem is the consistency there are dips as low as 49   you want an antivirus that is capable of good protection  especially against zeroday attacks  from one month to the next mse has been improving as of late  but it is still far below competitors in terms of protection   take a look at the october numbers for windows 10   https  wwwavtestorgenantivirushomewindows   see the little icon to the right of the product names  that is the avtest certification icon microsoft lost their certification from avtest in  october   2012     https  wwwavtestorgenantivirushomewindowswindows7october2012  and has nt been able to earn it back since  avtest makes easy to digest numbers for bloggers and end users a much more detailed source for techies is avcomparativesorg  avc   we re going to look at the results of the most important test  the realworld protection test the following data is sourced from  this chart   http  chartavcomparativesorgchart1php   note that mse is not even on that list avc does nt even consider mse an option instead they use it as a baseline for the absolute bare minimum protection that is represented by the white dotted line it s basically just a metric to embarrass other av providers for being worse than mse     month    mar  apr  may  jun  jul  aug  sep  oct  nov  dec                            blocked    846   899   909   918   896   928   931   957   970   945   in the  november 2015 realworld protection report   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201512avc_prot_2015b_enpdf  mse ranked 18th place 4th from last  in the  june 2015 realworld protection report   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201507avc_prot_2015a_enpdf  mse ranked 21st place dead last the same is true for  november   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201412avc_prot_2014b_enpdf  and  june   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201407avc_prot_2014a_enpdf  2014  gt  but what do all these numbers mean  8497100 seems like pretty good results  there s no such thing as a perfect antivirus as such when we score them we score them against others in the industry if you look at the green bars  malware actually blocked from infecting the machine using realtime scanning  in the avc chart you ll see nearly all of them are considerably higher than the  baseline  which represents mse now we re going to look at those numbers to make a few recommendations   there are a lot of options for free antivirus out there the numbers are nt everything  but they re very important let s look at some of the nonstatistical drawbacks of the top contenders so you wo nt rag on me for not recommending your favorite free av    avira   is out of the running because it includes a nag screen popup asking you to buy the full version there are ways to disable which involve hackery with file system permissions but that s for advanced users in my eyes this makes avira as  free  as winzip it s just an indefinite free trial    avg    while having respectable detection rates  has become an extremely bloated mess over the years it includes a bunch of crap you do nt need it is also prone to breaking things like your internet connection    malwarebytes   is not a comprehensive antivirus solution and the free version offers no realtime protection    avast   attempts to manipulate user s email without their consent by adding a   signature   advertisement to the bottom of all outbound emails it detects    comodo   sucks at detection rates  so what are we left with  here are the two best free antivirus programs as of the end of 2015    panda   http  wwwpandasecuritycomusahomeuserssolutionsfreeantivirus  panda has consistent toptier detection rates there is a nag screen but you can disable it permanently in the settings the drawback to panda comes in the performance hit panda ranks somewhere in the middle of the road for performance impact by both  avtest   https  wwwavtestorgencomparemanufacturerresults  and  avc   pdf   http  wwwavcomparativesorgwpcontentuploads201511avc_per_201510_enpdf   this performance impact is not going to be noticeable to your average user but if ricing your system is extremely important to you  move on to the final recommendation  on my windows 10 work laptop i run panda because i regularly connect it to potentially infected networks and sometimes must plug in possibly infected storage devices panda has nice usbscanning features like i said  computer repair guy here infected machines are a way of life for me not something i can avoid  if you re of the tinfoil hat variety  panda was founded by a scientologist but he is no longer the ceo there was some  controversy  in france in the late 90s about the thenceo making financial contributions to scientology no other allegations have been made relating to panda and scientology    bitdefender   http  wwwbitdefendercomsolutionsfreehtml    direct download link since some are having problems with redirects   http  downloadbitdefendercomnpdfreeantivirus_free_editionexe   if we re going purely by the numbers  bitdefender not only wins out over all the other free antivirus programs  but almost all of the paid versions as well the lowest score bitdefender received since march 2015 is 998  in the avc realworld test while regularly pulling in 100   in  october 2015 bitdefender got perfect scores   https  wwwavtestorgenantivirushomewindowswindows10october2015bitdefenderinternetsecurity20152016153791  for all metrics that avtest measures  i have a secondary windows 10 install on my main desktop and if i ran antivirus on it  i would run bitdefender my home antivirus is built into the network and i run linux 999  of the time so i do nt bother     but i m smart and i do nt visit shady sites or download sketchy files first off  quit acting like you do nt watch streaming porn you re not convincing me or anyone else i ve had dozens of customers look me square in the eye and insist they do nt watch porn while i have their motherfucking pornriddled   bookmarks bar   open in front of them if i do nt buy it from people who are paying me  i m not buying it from strangers already on the internet  second and most importantly  shady sites and downloads are not really what you should be concerned about the most what you should be concerned about are zeroday vulnerabilities in the software you run like flash  java  browser extensions  your browsers themselves   third party software and libraries used in other software you run   https  wwwopensslorgnewsvulnerabilitieshtml  y2015   and yes  even your  graphics drivers   http  wwwsecurityweekcomnvidiareleasesfixdangerousdisplaydriverexploit  which are exploited every day to serve malware to unsuspecting users via otherwise benign seeming means there are many completely trustworthy and legitimate sites and services that have been compromised to serve malware over the years  i do nt care how many science bitches made us more smarter  you should be running antivirus on your windows machine unless you re in it and know what you re doing no  building a couple of gaming rigs and running tron on your grandma s computer does not make you an it expert no   i ve never had an infection before and i do nt  is not an argument     but is there any reason to buy an antivirus program  short answer  no the primary reason for paying for antivirus is support that is  a number you can call where someone will remote into your machine for free and repair any issues that may come up as a result of viruses or the antivirus program breaking that can be handy for grandma who lives three hundred miles away and you do nt want to constantly remote into her machine to fix things your average user does nt need it  paid commercial antivirus programs usually are part of  security suites  that have a bunch of bloat features you do nt need or can get from other better  potentially free sources like password management  phishing protection  or browser filtering  and the final kick in the pants  more bloat  more opportunities to break kaspersky is considered the gold standard for detection rates it has been consistently at the top of the charts for many years however i spend an inordinate amount of time unfucking kaspersky because some part of it breaks  usually the updater norton is another antivirus that consistently breaks the machines it s installed on and can be a pain to remove if you do nt have the right tools one example is norton installs shell extensions  the custom options that show up when you right click on a file in file explorer  which regularly break in a way that causes file explorer to go into a launchcrash loop at boot making your pc unusable the less a piece of software does  the better chance it has of doing everything it does well    do i need a firewall to go with my antivirus  the answer is typically  no despite what hollywood has tried to teach us  a firewall is not some sophisticated piece of software with intelligently blocks hackers from your computer that kind of software exists  but is far outside the scope of even your typical power user a firewall simply blocks incoming and outgoing ports based on predefined rules windows comes with a completely passable firewall built in  as does every consumer router sold in the last decade if you re running windows behind a router  you re already behind two firewalls furthermore  the idea of someone  hacking  into your computer by breaking into it over a network is more or less  hollywood nonsense that does nt belong anywhere outside of bad ncis episodes   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  u8qgehh3keq   if your computer is compromised in a way to let an attacker in  it s because you ve been infected not because they broke through your two firewalls from behind seven proxies if you re actually at risk of being truly and properly  hacked  over a network  you re running servers on your network and hopefully know what you re doing already  i hope that was informative every time the discussion of free antivirus comes up on it turns into a huge confusing round of anecdotes and mud slinging hopefully this can address the common question of  well then what should i use   next time that discussion is raised  securing your computer is much more than just having the best

317,i ll probably get flak for this and a bunch of downvotes  oh well if an item is very important to you and you are going to pack it yourself  because everyones  good enough  differs  over pack it guidelines say one layer of bubble wrap  put 2 layers on guidelines specify 3 inches of peanuts surrounding the item  put 5 or 6 inches of peanuts around the item when you fill the box with peanuts  overload the box  so when you close the flaps on top to seal the box up  it packs the peanuts tight around your item i have even seen a box in a box pack you item like i said  then get an even bigger box  drop a layer of peanuts into the bottom of it  put the small box into the bigger box  dump more peanuts into the bigger box and surround the inner box with them  again overfill the box with peanuts so when you close the lid  it packs tight  now a lot of people will call me out for over doing it yeah it s overkill  however if the item means a lot to you or is one of a kind  would nt you rather go above and beyond to give it a better chance of arriving  years ago i worked for a ups store  i learned a lot and we had a great team that packed boxes well  which is another option if you really deeply care about your item  break out the wallet and have the ups store folks pack your item now days i think they even guarantee their work now i m not saying every single package will always make it unharmed you would nt believe how many people thought that marking a box as  fragile  would be its armor fragile may be good for the drivers picking up and delivering your items  but once at a terminal or hub  large machines built for efficiency and not made to look for the word fragile will be bumping  sliding and moving your package around at a fast rate  in closing  ups is a good company towards its customers but as with any group there are bad apples they are my preferred carrier and ever since i shipped my first box and to this day  i have never had an issue  something like 15 years  i will give op credit for covering their ass on stuff  my advice here is in hopes that it never have to make it to that level ,d00lndt,youshouldknow,learning,1455542588.0,im_trainman,10.0,0.0,981,1949,1.0

322,i work for a company that received dozens of packages a day from ups  and ships out hundreds each day the biggest weapon you have in getting a successful damage claim is having the recipient deny the shipment due to damage  when the ups guy shows up at your door with a package  inspect the package before you sign for it if there is even a hint at damage  tell him that you want to either inspect the contents before signing  or just refuse the package because of damage especially if you are dealing with a mediumsized business  this will usually lead to a replacement being shipped  often before they even get the damaged back if you are shipping personal items  this obviously does nt help as much also  be careful  because they may try redeliver the same package again the next business day ,d01dmv7,youshouldknow,learning,1455587061.0,SovietShooter,1.0,0.0,266,7528,0.0

324,my best tips for shipping   if you can lower the weight and or value of a single package by separating them into different parcels  do this instead of paying for insuranceextra weight costs   if it is nt summer  be sure to add a little extra tape to seal all the seams of the box and even wrap a few around the entire circumference of the box in a    pattern to secure its shape   only ship through official upsusps locations  not any third partyaffiliated storefront because their package handling training and package liability are both garbage   if there ever is a problem  go to the location it was shipped  or the primary shipping center near you  and start demanding to speak with someone who can help you with your claim until you get help or speak with a manager and you can escalate things as needed from there their phoneemail techs seem trained to avoid liability for damage claims and i ve literally had them hang up midcall with me before not as easy to hang up on someone inperson  i ve worked with ups package handlers before  they do nt care what s inside the box you want to package your parcel in a way that makes it okay to toss on the ground or inout the back of a vehicle ,d014soz,youshouldknow,learning,1455573187.0,PseudoChris,4.0,0.0,30,765,0.0

638,for all you wondering why  ethanol and water go together better than gas and water what i mean is that ethanol will mix with water readily  like food coloring in water  whereas standard gas will not mix with water  but rather will float on top of water also ethanol will absorb   50   times as much water as gas  meaning you now have watered down fuel this water will promote rust and negatively affect the oil on the piston sleeve  causing it to not be as well lubricated  which in turn causes premature wear on your engine  destroying it  ninja edit  source http  wwwfueltesterscomexpiration_of_ethanol_gashtml,czlcikx,youshouldknow,learning,1454442569.0,ViperCodeGames,5.0,0.0,1467,6868,0.0

660,as your income increases into a new tax bracket   only  the money in that new bracket  not your total income  is taxed at the higher rate it s a myth and a fallacy that anyone would ever bring home less money after transitioning into a higher tax bracket  for example  with bernie s tax plan  someone making  250001 would have an increase in taxes in their  highest  tax bracket from 33  to 37   but it s not going from 33  to 37  of  total  income  it s going from 33  to 37  of income  between  250001 to  500000   because we use a marginal tax rate system so they re paying the same percent as everyone else on the first few brackets of their income  and only income  at or above  the  250001 mark would be taxed at a higher rate someone making  250001 a year would then have an increase in taxes in that bracket from  033 to  037  for a total increase of  004 a year  with  current tax rates   here s the total of what a single person with no children making  250001 a year pays in taxes  bracket ratetax  01845010    184500  184517490015    846750  7490115120025    1907500  15120123045028    2219000  23045141150033    645183  total taxes paid  5802933 as you can see  the tax in the 33  bracket is pretty low that s because they re only paying taxes on the  19550   250001230451  that they made  in that bracket   under bernie s plan  for example  the tax rates will change slightly here s how  bracket ratetax  01845010    184500  184517490015    846750  7490115120025    1907500  15120123045028    2219000  23045125000033    645150  25000150000037    037  total taxes paid  5802937 as you can see   only  the money  at or above   250001 is taxed in the highest bracket in this example  this person s taxes increased by  004 per year by switching to bernie s tax plan  you can use  this   http  wwwbernietaxcom  calculator to see how bernie s plan would affect what you take home every year ,44x5ca,youshouldknow,learning,1455031616.0,pooyah_me,24.0,0.0,233,3366,0.0

1105,in a nutshell  when a researcher claims their research is statistically significant  all this means is that the researcher has used mathematics to determine with confidence that the independent variable s effect on the dependent variable is  not due to chance   for example  a researcher could say   i think that cellphones cause cancer  they could then do a variety of expensive research methods to come up with the  hypothetical  conclusion that  yes  they re confident that  all variables accounted for  cell phones can cause cancer at a 001  higher rate in comparison to the population that does nt use them that does nt sound like much  does it  like maybe it s so low a percent that it does nt really even have practical use  well guess what  that result is still  statistically significant   simply because the researchers have determined that the result was not due to chance  now this is different from what statistically meaningfulpractically significant means in regards to research for something to be statistically meaningful or practically significant  the results not only must be not due to chance  but they must be large or meaningful enough that we should  actually care   unfortunately  this line can something be fairly arbitrary  take the previous example how much of an increased cancer risk from cell phone use are we willing to tolerate before it makes any difference at all in our behaviour  001   01   1   5   as high as 10   or higher  the line is not clear cut when do the results become statistically meaningful  unfortunately  this is probably going to be unique to each specific research topic  the real takeaway from this is  though  that just because you see research claiming its results are statistically significant  does nt automatically mean you should care the real question comes from whether or not the results are dramatic enough that they make a practical difference in how we interact with or interpret the topic of research and  that  is what being statistically meaningful is all about  clarification edit  so  looks like some people out there are upset at the term statistically meaningful this is the term that i was taught to use  so it s the term i think of when i m assessing research if you d like to use the term practically significant or substantial significance or effect size or clinical significance  if you re in medicine   great  or if you have another term  that s fine too  the main things i m trying to help people take away from this is that  1  the term statistically significant  might not mean what you think it does  especially if you re not familiar with reading and interpreting research  and  2  you should try to think critically about research and how it s advertised  as to the example i used  i know it s limited i purposefully tried not to include a bunch of statistical jargon so that it would be easier for the average person to understand i understand in doing that there is a tradeoff between ease of understanding and realismaccuracy there are  of course  a multitude of other elements to consider when assessing research  but i tried to use an example that narrowly illustrated the one i chose  also  thank you for gold  stranger that was very kind  ,41r5m9,youshouldknow,learning,1453242789.0,almostlucid,736.0,0.0,3253,5227,1.0

1277,gt  the researcher has used mathematics to determine with confidence that the independent variable s effect on the dependent variable is not due to chance  and gt  the researchers have determined that the result was not due to chance  this is incomplete at best  and misleading test for statistical significance are used with an associated significance level  in most case 5   what this  more or less  means is that there is still a 5  chance that your results are not statistically significant  you can of course use a smaller threshold  but in general people will try to use the smallest possible threshold  and are limited by the size of the effect andor the number of their samples  but you never  ever  determine for sure that your results are not due to chance  there are numerous cases  however  where you can use an absurdly small threshold for your test  which is as close as we get to being sure of something   tl  dr  a significance test is meaningless without the associated significance level edit  two nice xkcds illustrating this  https  xkcdcom882 https  xkcdcom1478,cz566d1,youshouldknow,learning,1453298255.0,kougabro,9.0,0.0,1,115,0.0

1279,okay since some of the comments in here are insanely arrogant and uammicha is really the only one who gets it  the point of this is really exploiting base 10 arithmetic remember the finger trick to keep track of multiples of 9  you can do the same thing with 5 base 6  all these rules come from writing the number out in base 10  applying modular arithmetic by whatever number you want to find a pattern for  set it equal to zero and see what you can figure out this is what that other user laid out nicely so i wont bother with it again it is covered in any first semester elementary number theory class  some fun stuff  the reason why 6 works by just testing 2 and 3 is because 2 and 3 are coprime meaning you cant test for divisibility by 12 by checking 2 and 6 since they are not coprime  1433 is prime  lets come up with a rule  some people also came up with some really inconvenient rules  but these are good in instances when factorization is tough and multiplication is easy  hint  always  http  arxivorgftpmathpapers00010001012pdf,cyweaqx,youshouldknow,learning,1452669733.0,Sygnon,3.0,0.0,180,2473,0.0

3080,i m a health insurance employee in arkansas specifically  i order medical records for charges that have been flagged by our system what we look for is medical necessity for the most part sometimes we may also be looking to make sure something should be addressed by the patient s health insurance  or if it should be covered instead by their dental insurance or worker s comp  at no point have i ever requested any kind of records from a mental health provider at no point have i ever known anyone else to request such records frankly  the idea of somebody being able access very intimate information about a patient s treatment is frightening the very reason why therapy in so effective for many people is that they have a place where they can share their deepest  and oftentimes scariest  feelings with zero consequences should their health insurance carrier use anything they say in therapy against them or  god forbid  there s a data breach  that person s ability to trust anyone will forever be compromised  this is shitty  like i ve never seen if you go to therapy  please know that not every state and not every insurance carrier does this if you have any concerns about such policies  write your insurance carrier s legal department and ask them if your therapist s notes are subject to medical review  be safe take care of yourself be informed ,czvn4nf,youshouldknow,learning,1455162792.0,spunkychickpea,4.0,0.0,4271,32824,0.0

3091,boy have i ever learned this the hard way  i was prescribed some topical steroids for a small patch of eczema i had the doctor at the walk in i went to prescribed a fairly big container of it too so i applied it fairly liberally as time went on my eczema kept spreading and getting worse and when i would go off of it the itching was insane i finally got a regular gp who prescribed a higher potency steroid cream did that for a month and when i got off that cream my eczema came back the worst it has ever been i could nt sleep  the itching was just pure insanity  my skin was also flaking and shedding like it never had before my skin was literally falling off  finally i found out about topical steroid withdrawal i had all the symptoms of it and i found that i had totally been abusing these medications for years i ve been off them for a year now and i m still dealing with symptoms in addition to messing up my skin  my adrenal glands also got messed up due to the excess cortisol that was in these cortisone creams  the real annoying thing about it is that i still have nt been formally diagnosed with tsw i have seen 3 different dermatologists about it and they wo nt touch the issue with a 10 foot pole they just say it s eczema and prescribe 1 of 3 things  more steroid creams  protopic  which i am also very wary of  or light therapy  so ya  be your own advocate and do your research about what drugs your doctor is prescribing for you and what the possible side effects can be ,cztq4n4,youshouldknow,learning,1455043310.0,RobotOrgy,4.0,0.0,2205,24243,0.0
