74,75,it s not his fault  coming from a sports background  he can not truly connect with the players and understand how they feel i m not sure if he played the game or not but to understand a gamer  he would need to play the game and feel the same frustration the players are feeling in episode 4  he failed to see how frustrated the team was with winning against a team with 3 subs  and when he said  can they smile    i guess that pissed off the players to have a coach who do nt understand them how do you coach a team when you do nt know how they think or feel ,d02rr3o,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455678931.0,OneLastDream,1.0,0.0,271.0,140.0,0.0

83,84,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,34.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0

86,87,thooorin really managed to hit the nail on the head here while he has questionable knowledge about some of the inner workings of the game  he is very good at extrapolating and referencing his points in making a strong argument  kc was never shown having a strong impact on the players and yes  while we base that on the legends series  why is it after 4 episodes we see nothing of positive consequence when he speaks  while it is not defining of how effective he is as a coach to tsm  it does give a hint towards a certain idea  i think what people fail to recognize is that the current iteration of tsm is not like any of the previous iterations of tsm  which thooorin mentions i think kc would have been a pretty good head coach for tsm of season 5  but he lacks the ability to control as many large voices as currently exist in tsm season 6  also that ending alphadraft plug was gold ,d025mud,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647056.0,mochaderp,2.0,0.0,1.0,2808.0,0.0

90,91,i stopped being able to listen when he was using tsm legends as evidence  up until then he was really on point and i do nt mean to trash the video  but come on it s a reality show  it s not reality the bits they re showing us might as well be the players putting on skits in between their real work like  i like reality shows  but you have to take them for what they are  edit  for people who are unclear on what i mean  let me expand in a reality show  you can prompt people into an artificial situation  ie   kc  give a speech to the team so that we can get that on film   and ask them to respond naturally and even though you re asking them to respond naturally  it does nt mean they will continuing that previous example  maybe kc never gives speeches or even if he does  knowing he s preparing it for legends will change how he delivers it the reactions of everyone else are similarly affected maybe they d normally be jumping in and having a discussion  but because this is  kc s speech time for the camera   they let him talk  maybe bjergsen is asked  bjergsen  how do you feel about this   and sometime when he d normally just sit on his opinion  he expresses it and he comes off as a diva  or maybe he is  but we  do nt know    by prompting someone to do something or say something  even if you ask them to do it naturally  you still can get a contrived situation   everyone  greet svenskeren as he comes in  gives you porn level acting   also  reality shows are trying to tell a cohesive story and editing can severely affect how people look usually audiences will underestimate this  but the affect can be really huge if you want  you can edit basically anyone to look any way you want  as long as they ve ever acted this way someone s the nicest person ever except when they re starving  and they were starving twice this week  i can make it look like they re being nasty to their teammates continually or i can make it look like they re the nicest person ever the truth is somewhere in between  on that vein  if kc s been a not perfect  but pretty good coach  and i m not assuming that  but just for example   i can make him look like the best coach ever or the worst  depending on how that fits my story now  tsm legends is nt looking to vilify the players or staff  so they are nt going to make him look like the worst worst  but in trying to tell a very condensed version of the story  some extreme simplifying is going to happen anyway  because there are only 30ish minutes per episode  and a lot of that time is earmarked for game time  player confessionals  team post game analysis  etc   and you can end up thinking  and this is an example to illustrate my point  not actually what people think   wow  kc is lethargic and unenergetic all the time   when the reality could be  continuing that example  that kc is tired in the mornings ,d025h5s,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455646843.0,thewamp,8.0,0.0,2.0,6384.0,0.0
91,92,thorin s honestly right about yellowstar  he s not a great laning support  but an amazing team shot caller and captain for regi to say  after bringing in yellowstar himself  that he does nt want one main shot caller for the team is insane that just diminishes yellowstars worth to the team almost entirely honestly  if kasing had stay d with tsm i believe they would nt have started so poorly  and in my prediction i believe yellowstar will leave tsm or they will continue to fail internationally ,d025ztz,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455647543.0,d-art12,33.0,0.0,1.0,648.0,0.0
92,93,thoorin is pretty much spot on  tsm have probably the best midlander in the nalcs  one of the best adcs in the nalcs  and yellowstar a very good to support and very good captainshotcaller they should think we re gon na work hard  we re gon na work together  and we re gon na fuck up the whole league thoorin is also spot on that there is a difference between channeling ego in positive and negative ways  the thing that i see is that tsm are not utilizing the pieces they have to their maximum effect yellowstar not shotcalling and not captaining is like having hai and not letting him do his thing also  while the macro synergy is getting better  it s still not there  tsm  right now  is like having a swiss army knife and just using one tool  the reason teams work is because people know  understand  and execute their roles tsm do nt really know or understand their roles  and because of that  they ca nt execute those roles  will this fix itself  if they find a good coach that can get everyone on the same page  or the team can solve their problems themselves  then yes saying you re not on the same page is step 1  but there s about 10 steps after that that are more important  including being able to speak frankly to each other without feeling being hurt about whats been going wrong and how to fix it  giving people a clear framework of what they want to do  how they re going to do it  and what everyone s roles in that are  this is ingame stuff  these are the things i see  edit  it s also pretty hilarious that some of you seem to think he wears a coat in all of his video  when if you d watched the video to the end  you ll see thumbnails of some more of his videos  and most of them he s not wearing a coat however  do nt let facts get in the way of your memes  reddit we would nt want that  would we   ,d02e0wa,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455658260.0,TheKiggles,2.0,0.0,1.0,3387.0,0.0

149,150,i think the problems threatening the future of league of legends esports scene go deeper than just riot s balance design philosophies  to name a few other things  riot s own game design philosophy as it relates to individual skill is illconducive to a budding esports scene  most egregious example in this regard is the lack of a training mode  sandbox mode as it s been dubbed  and the stated reasoning for that i call this the worst example because they outright endorse an ineffective means of improving as the preferred method to a lesser extent  lack of replays is another example that s often cited being because of technical issues but they ve had years to work through those issues and it this point it s obvious it is nt a priority both sandbox and replays as well as the design philosophies needed to make them a reality would far better facilitate the growth of the esports scene than the current atmosphere they ve fostered  another problem is lol esports  at least in na  is the risk adverse playstyle amongst the teams it s not exciting to watch two teams attempt to wait each other out  to wait for the earliest mistake and end the game on that i m not entirely convinced these players realize their job is to entertain people  unless they do there s not much of a future for league of legends in the esports scene ,d02jrsw,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455666568.0,thebiggiewall,0.0,0.0,63.0,10665.0,0.0

155,156,this is a funny quirk of the interaction  the tp and w basically happened at once  which caused the tp to freak out and go on cooldown this only happens if you re really close enough in server ticks  if syndra w s a minion that is already through the tp animation  05 seconds or more   the person will land normally her w does nt actually interfere with tp normally  it will even remove the visual  but the tper will still land it s actually bad to do this because it will make your team think the tp cancelled when it did nt ,d01dm19,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455587026.0,OverlordForte,31.0,0.0,4.0,4124.0,0.0

312,313,so a few things that help me  cause i get upset too but have worked on it the new queue system has helped this a ton because now i do nt need to worry about playing something i dont want to play  from best advise and down  1 play to have fun so many people forget this if you re queuing up just to prove to yourself or anyone else that you can do well then you ve got a bigger issue  2 play music and ignore negative comments  3 understand that if you really are a much better player you will eventually get out of the current rank and eventually be placed where you need to be  4 number two is important and while it may seem like you ve wasted 30 mins because you ve lost due to someone incompetence it should be a learning experience becausing losing is inevitable there is no reason to not try and at least make the best of every situation  5 too many times has this game gone from a sure win to an absolute loss giving up at 20 mins is good if you re running low on time but encouraging your team and playing the game out can lead to a wonderful win  6 play with a friend that keeps you in check someone who can calm you or give you direction the game is more fun with friends anyway  7 lastly kills are awesome and they make you feel good when you get them but you re more likely to win if you complete the objectives always have an objective in mind when your top is getting ganked by 5 people then the other 4 people on your team better be pushing lanes or doing dragon  this should all be common advise by now but thought i d type it out cause it helps remind me of whats important anyway  ,d02fbjl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659966.0,savaj,5.0,0.0,14.0,88.0,0.0

434,435,i actually think ahri is getting nerfed the wrong way  charm can not cancel dashes anymore   i mean  i know ahri deserves some nerfs  but i do nt think this is a good way to nerf her  actually placing a charm while a dash is part of the potential of outplay  plus  laning against leblanc as ahri is actually already rough  it will totally destroy this lane  i actually think ahri should be more rewarded when hitting her skillshots correctly  her base damage should maybe be nerfed and the old bonus damage applied on charmed target should come back  giving more cd but reseting the cd or half cd if the target gets killed   ahri is a burst mage  or even an assassin  it s normal that she can one burst anyone  but it should happen while playing it correctly  not by spamming w r ignite  i mean  using the charm to cancel a dash is an important part of the gameplay  it punishes other s mistakes and gives counterplay  welp  i made this post most likely to know other s opinion and to share mine i know most of people are a lot salty about ahri  but i think it s understandable that this is not a good way to nerf her  at least  that s what i thought  got ta tag uvertigahri to know your opinion since you re a otp ahri ,464gac,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455655034.0,RivenBadChampKappa,1187.0,0.0,1274.0,5408.0,0.0

465,466,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,341.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

469,470,if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to 80 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1812  lux binding 1511  anivia q 128  brand stun 86  leblanc chains 148 and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game ,d02hqy7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663412.0,Kagormund,34.0,0.0,1.0,231.0,0.0

526,527,biggest change for me when i played hots after playing lol for years was not buying items i couldnt get over it idk why but it made the game feel simple and characters were only allowed one role or so it felt when i played at release have nt gone back they have recommended builds but i would also recommend looking them up for the current season all of the 450 champs are pretty decent especially poppy she was recently reworked so i d recommend getting them first do not buy runes until you re sumoner level 20 and can buy tier 3 runes otherwise you re wasting ip  influence points you gain from games   another thing is lanes i dont recall lanes being much of a thing in hots  but the na meta rn is a solo top lane which is generally a tankybruiser charecter with a jungle also will most likely be tankybruiser but they do have assassin jungles as well  then you got solo mid which is generally a ranged ap champ finally on bottom you got 2 champs 1  adc  attack damage carry  theyre job is to get fed and stack a bunch of ad  attack speed and crit chance the other on bottom is the support  generally a champ with good crowd control or healing abilities  or both  sorry for wall of text i can just think of a lot of little tips for someone starting ,d01r3dg,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455617183.0,daogrande,8.0,0.0,309.0,1071.0,0.0

531,532,i posted this as a comment on the actual page but figured i could put it here as well  having attended msi last year i am glad about some of the changes   double round robin format taking away the bluered side bias  extending the group stage to more days  last year having 15 matches in 2 days was crazy  and it ran so late locally we did not get to have meet and greets most days the change to having 30 matches in 5 days basically means that we are having 25 less matches a day   splitting the semifinal matches into separate days is also a smart idea as most people left or the crowd was dead last year after the sktvsfnatic semifinal  the only thing that worries me is the extended time  last year msi ended and 10 days later lck started  if they expect teams to compete and then 3 days later start their summer split  i could see some of the top tier teams choosing not to go  edit  formatting,d02s9gl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455679767.0,James179,2.0,0.0,1.0,42.0,0.0

545,546,i started to play lol after about 2000 games of hots  and jaina was my most played hero in ranked  i hate artanis though   so we re in similar positions  here s what i can tell you   the champions in lol are more complex than the heroes in hots  in general   and there are a lot more of them this means it will take you a lot longer to get to the point where you can counter play effectively you ll probably feel quite lost in your first games due to the sheer amount of gamechampion knowledge that you re still lacking   you might be disappointed in how most matches unfold compared to hots hots has a more modern design  you spend more time of the game doing interesting stuff compared to lol there are 10 different maps  which keeps the game experience diversified and fresh in league of legends you ll find that most matches amount to a laning phase followed by a very drawn out team fight in the mid lane this is not true for higher ranked games  but you wo nt be in high ranked games for a  long  time in other words  you might actually be very disappointed by that aspect of lol  overall flow of the game    related to the above  league of legends  like dota  has a  laning phase  which is usually at least 15 minutes long  and that you spend farming gold from minions  and trying to outplay your lane opponent  s   only  very  very rarely  are these first 15 minutes of the game more interesting than the first 15 minutes of a hots game  hots games only last 20 minutes on average   and you have to do it in every game  regarding your specific question  jaina is a backline damage dealer that depends a lot on good positioning and clever application of your crowd control artanis is your typical tanky melee bruiser  with that in mind  you ll probably enjoy morgana  lux  orianna  leblanc morgana and lux are both good because you can play them solo in the mid lane and as support champions in the bot lane  artanis corresponds to champions like fiora  riven  volibear  malphite  hecarim  shyvana  who are tanky and still capable of dealing damage  unfortunately it s not easy to compare lol and hots in this fashion  because the games are designed quite differently  and so are the heroes  i like to play tanks in hots  because it gives me a lot of control over team fights  but in lol i do nt really care about that  because full blown team fights are more rare  and tanks play differently  so at the end of the day you have to try out all roles and enough champions to find out for yourself  you should also refer to the following sources for information   championgg  the league of legends wiki  youtube and twitch to be honest i find most of the guide websites pretty bad  the average quality of the guides is low there are good ones but you wo nt find them easily while you still need them ,d01u141,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455627816.0,siggboy,56.0,0.0,1.0,84.0,0.0

601,602,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,608.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0

611,612,i still think it s a huge mistake to fire a coach who has only been with the org for a few months just because he is nt up to par yet if that is literally the only reason he was being let go then why are the players also not being let go  they definitely had nt been performing to expectation until their game against clg  which still was nt mind blowing  makes me wonder if this was nt another instance of regi trying to step in too much and undermining the authority of kc there s a reason the owners of traditional sports are nt involved in the coaching of the team at all or it could be the players  having no background in traditional sports  got their ego s bruised a bit by the coaching methods that kc brought and tucked their tails and went to papa regi or  he could have legit just been bad at his job as the announcement implies  i think the most likely scenario is that it was a combination of all of those situations  but i m not privy to any inside information  he could have stolen leena s candy bar for all i know  i do want to reiterate  regi should not  in any way  be involved in the coaching of the team if he wants his players to respect a hired coach he should either coach the team  or own the team if you ve hired someone to coach  let them coach if they become ineffective  fire them  hire a new coach  but do not step in and undermine their authority ,d02rffn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455678400.0,Darktire,1.0,0.0,29.0,7632.0,0.0

662,663,unfortunately  if you can not hold back from typing negative things that are nt constructive in game  there s not much to do aside from stop typing  which you said you do nt like doing  biggest thing i d recommend is that you should try to recognize that a  in every scenario  in every situation that goes badly  where you might try to chat to attack or belittle your teammates  instead try to rethink the situation into a  what more could i have done there   rather than  what more could they have done there    it helps you shift frustration into a learning tool  and redirects potential anger you have towards teammates towards yourself or the game if you do this  you can make negative experiences into somewhat helpful learning experiences  b  unless you phrase your comments very specifically  your chat wo nt be seen as criticisms  but rather as just insults the easiest way to get less toxic when you chat to other players is that you work on how you say things understand that if you see a teammate die 4 times in a row top lane against riven  you saying  you fucking suck stop feeding  does nt accomplish anything at all instead  do nt make reference to how bad they are doing  but give a criticism or advice all the same  something along the lines of  hey  you should play more passively and build armor  and just sit tight so riven does nt snowball anymore   c  you need to be more humble  less proud  in game this one is usually the hardest for toxic players to accomplish because they typically view themselves as superior to their fellow players  and it causes you to react in a way that you feel the need to control or influence the game more than you are by just playing your champion trust me on this one  if you can change your mindset in game from  these idiots suck  why ca nt i get good teammtes  to  these guys are having bad games  and there is nt much i can do to stop that aside from playing well  from  they re doing these obviously bad plays that i would never make  to  i ca nt play for them  so i should just do as good as i can and help if they need it  from  i know what they are doing wrong and they should stop doing said thing  to  they probably know that they are doing poorly  i should just do my best and move on  in every scenario  you should be focusing on yourself and how you play  and recognize that chatting negatively wo nt help at all if you change your viewpoint  no matter what  seriously  to  i m the only person i should be criticizing  it not only improves your play  it helps reduce the negativity you feel and act on in game ,d02g9ch,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455661280.0,walkur1005,2.0,0.0,227.0,194.0,0.0

997,998,just in case the website goes down gt  tsm coach changes kc was released yesterday on february 15th in the evening initially  we brought him on with the expectation that he would be the  life coach  or  out of game coach   his duties as a life coach was to help players maintain healthy relationships amongst each other  with their own lives  and to help them maintain a competitive mindset throughout the season at the beginning  we felt that he had a lot of great ideas regarding how to achieve this  and his background in traditional sports seemed to be a solid fit  gt  we wanted to keep kc on and try to work with him through the situations that arose  but he was unable to progress at a rate where he could become the coach we needed given our limited time he was unable to transition his background into the esports scene  causing a lack of understanding between him and the players while his methods may have been effective in a traditional sports setting  it was ineffective for our team  gt  with this being said  we would like to thank kc for his efforts and time with us we wish him good luck on his future endeavors currently  we have several candidates in mind as a suitable replacement in his position  and we will give an update as soon as it is available ,d02nilb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455672365.0,GETTlNG,37.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1006,1007,i think that one thing people seem to forget is the tsm culture we always talk about how regi commands the room when he talks  and sure that is a personality thing  but one thing that people forget is that regi is the boss  the head of tsm kc is the head coach  but it seems like it was never really established that he is the head coach the same happened with locodoco when regi stepped in  and when that takes place  the coach will automatically lose power in the team it s hard to know what kc really did for the team  but it seems like in tsm s culture  with such strong personalities  it would be pretty difficult for kc or anyone  without esports background  to command any kind of respect just my two cents ,d026pxo,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455648523.0,LOLRyanTurk,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1011,1012,he is correct in saying some of he things he has the woodbuck comments were not justified and based on speculation and filling in narrative but the general team analysis was good tsm is struggling with their team synergy and that is because the roles of each player are not yet fully defined this is evident in the tsm legends videos and the players continually saying so   we are nt clicking   trying to find my place   we are nt on the same page  etc paraphrasing   their last game vs clg we saw a pretty good improvement from past weeks the jgsup roam was good and the grouping to skirmish or take objectives was also improved but you can see it multiple times where yellowstar probably called for something  engage and have his team follow up a split second too late  not entirely as crisp as it should have been for a super team    he does make a very good point in what yellowstar bring to the team if you do nt let him shotcall and control the macro game  why bring him in at all  that is his strength it will take time in the end i feel as if bjersen is still trying to make calls from old habits  he was the leader of 20142015 tsm  he made that team work he is learning to let the reigns go and trust in yellowstar and the new tsm hierarchy  i also think that svenskeren looks bad because of the lack of cohesion not 100  on individual play he can play aggressive but needs his team to back him up  he is a great jungler he does nt necessarily have to play a supportive role either  look at peanut for the rox tigers  he plays ultra aggressive and does nt need to invest heavily into wards  he is a ward he tracks the enemy jg by constantly invading and controlling the enemy his team is also willing to invade and skirmish with him svenskeren has the ability to do the same thing and so does the team tsm just needs to be willing to play around that  ys roams  dl plays safer and willing to lose farm  bjerg controlling the opposing mid  and hauntzer controlling the opposing top laner  more factors but you get the point probably   obviously more time is needed to really see if this team is world class ,d02k6az,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455667234.0,lowfatbutter,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1014,1015,this is why  generally speaking  teams  in traditional sports  pickfind a coach and have the coach build the team in the usual case of a team already existing  they let the coach make roster decisions if the coach handpicks the players  you have someone to goto when things are nt working out because of the simple fact that the coach built the team not every coach will work well with certain players and obviously  tsm was nt going to let kc get rid ofreplace players on their team it can be difficult to fit in a coach that works with such strong personalities that are in tsm hopefully tsm can find a new coach before katowice and all the best to kc ,d022we2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643325.0,tjfllo,2.0,0.0,756.0,4870.0,0.0

1101,1102,imo  the way to nerf ahri is buffing the power of her skillshots while nerfing the power of her w and r when i started to get into ahri i was shocked by how unreliant she actually is on hitting her skillshots what  should  be a high skillcap champion can just bum rush an adc with r while spamming w with 40  cdr and just assassinate them without using any other spells  without any room for outplay on the victim s part unless they can burst her down faster than she bursts them down  which is really fast  even without skillshots   add ignite to the mix for more brainless  nonskillshot burst  ahri mains will always circle jerk that she s hard to play and you need to good at hitting skillshots to be good at ahri while you do need to be good with skillshots to get the best out of her  as someone who s awful at them  i can testify to the fact that you absolutely do nt need it to get results on ahri   http  iimgurcomtmkvcappng   i love playing her for that reason but it s also awful to play against and highly counterintuitive when her kit was clearly meant to require her to hit her skillshots to do well  rather than just being an additional reward while her w and r are already more than enough on their own in so many situations  i think her r is basically fine  on its own it s not a problem  the main reason it looks like an issue is that the gap closing is such an easy enabler for her w  which is the real problem imo w requires a nerf to either the damage or the cooldown  or a mix of both making it harder to assassinate targets with 23 r charges and 2 w s makes it more important for her to be able to land her skillshots  one or both of which can receive small buffs to help keep her overall power the same  so long as you re playing mechanically well and not just mashing r and w in the general direction of the person you want to kill  my thoughts on riot s nerf is that it s strange to nerf one of her skillshots rather than hitting her unhealthy gameplay pattern  but the nerf itself actually does make a lot of sense all things considered  it s not a displacement cc so it should nt cancel out dashes i do nt think they re aiming to directly nerf ahri s power with that change as much as they re just trying to make their game more consistent but i think ahri  is  a champion they should take a closer look at  she really needs some power shifts in her kit ,d02mhwd,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455670797.0,VaporaDark,5.0,0.0,975.0,9420.0,0.0

1158,1159,as much as reddit is going to want this juicy details  this is pretty close to a perfect release statement  it s better for tsm and it s better for woodbuck to keep whatever drama they had behind closed doors professional relationships end  it happens this way  no one gets shit on their face as long as there is nt something truly bad going on  eg  some of the shit that was happening with selfie  for example   we do nt need to hear about how someone was nt listening or someone was nt getting along ,d02191s,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455640999.0,thewamp,15.0,0.0,2.0,6384.0,0.0

1334,1335,  dota    games feel super slow  you do nt feel influential because it seems to be all about wave control and denying creeps  graphics give me a headache iowisp was the only champ i ever had any fun with whenever i tried it shiny    smite    kukulkan is fun remember to spam vgg it s worth a laugh with friends but does nt keep my attention graphics also give me a headache    strife    have nt played it since release lots of champs seemed like fun blends of league champs  like the ekkoevelynn assasin  the playerbase was too small to actually have 5v5 pvp games when i played  willing to give it another try    infinite crisis    dead   seemed similar to dota insofar as a new player feels like they are nt influential anyone who has their champ s combo down will decimate you before you can even build tanky minions did nt seem to matter much either shazam was the best of course game servers shut down after the majority of the player base left in protest to changes i believe    heroes of the storm    no complaints about not feeling influential here all the spells were constructed in such a way as to feel the power behind them unfortunately due to the game s rules then everyone else is just as powerful as you and it really just ends up becoming an adc simulatorfarmville  who can guide their minions to victory the fastest  i have no real complaints with it  but i just do nt have fun  might just be because i ve never played blizzard games and half the appeal is the characters    gigantic     i love this game the graphics are a blast the characters range from fairly original to outright amazing it s usually a pubstomp one way or the other but when teams are fairly matched then the games get intense  tyto is the best character  i wish it had nt become win10 only it s left me unable to play after finally getting into the closed alphasbetas after 2 years of waiting i doubt i ll be playing it anytime in the future    adventure time battle party    surprisingly balanced in my opinion wish there were a larger playerbase if only to get better opponents  gunther op  wenk     battleborn    it s almost out is nt it  i never got into the betas    paragon    see battleborn  even though most of my friends have long moved on from league  and mobas in general   they re just toxic or easily stressed people so the game burnt them out even though they were the ones that brought me into it  by force  league is still the only moba that keeps bring me back over and over i have very little free time in my life right now  and assuming i m home and finished my obligations 95  of the time i ll be playing league ,d02hbag,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455662783.0,zaquanimus,1.0,0.0,1991.0,7440.0,0.0

1472,1473,i played a little bit of dota2 i thought the graphical style was kind of cool much darker and more realistic than league  but i almost felt like the map was too dark  if that makes any sense  i played about 10 games of heroes of the storm i honestly felt it was like  moba for kids    too casual for me i even youtubed a pro game to see if there was something i was missing from what i can tell  there does nt seem to be much outplay potential in hots as there is in league and dota it seems like no one really did any damage  or made any sort of amazing plays  things like a thresh lantern to save a teammate  or a god like hook to catch an enemy carry malphite or orianna ult to win a team fight  crazy vayne 1 v 2 out plays  etc none of these things seem to exist in hots from what i ve seen ,d02cr0p,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455656553.0,drnick5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1477,1478,i think hots is actually really fun i played it with my friends as a 5 man team for a bit i liked how you didnt have to focus in cs and there wasnt items either so you could roam and actually have some team play rather than just being a selfish dick and farming all day  but i think the problem with that game is you actually need a lot of team play so i can imagine it being more frustrating to play with 4 other strangers ,d02l3nx,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455668679.0,Invisibleufo,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1478,1479,i played a lot of dota i think i ve now beat dota with how much i played league  but i know i played 700 hours of dota the only problem for me is that dota s ui is too big and the lack of champions i just felt stuck even though dota has my favorite moba champion and build path to date  tidehunter and the tentacle hentai build  i also played a little bit of hots  it was fun at first and then the inconsistency drove me away  even though i had so much fun with the champs in that game ,d02dhvy,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455657554.0,a_Dreem,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1833,1834,well the first most influential thing that happened was the fight between kespa and blizzard that ended starcraft s mainstream popularity in korea this is very important because it made room for other games like league of legends which would likely never have grown this much otherwise it is also important because it meant that western teams would start to get shit on by koreans and would be forced to invest more money in things like coaches if they wanted to have a chance to compete which in turn made league of legends grow even more  as a consequence of that clg  which were the most popular and most american  team at the time  left na and went to compete in korea and that made them lose many fans which allowed tsm to settle themselves as the na favorites  the most important best of 5 in history was perhaps ktb vs skt in s3 which ultimately decided the winner of the entire world championship tornament which meant the begining of skt s league of legends dynasty  also this play happened https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  o8vgac4ozis   kta vs ssb was an awesome best of 5 but it was irrelevant as the results of that set never really translated into anything ,d02jnnn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455666344.0,MrDTS,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1945,1946,i think this only nerfs experienced ahri players newer ahri players do nt go for prediction charms so this wo nt change much in platinum or lower  i think they should reduce her safety and increase her dmg just a bit  in skillshots   make ulti cd longer or make q mov speed scaling with levels  also i would love to have less dmg in her w and a bit more in her skillshots maybe reduce w dmg and give charm dmg amp back  i think this is a bit weird nerf i think she is balanced but she just need few slight changes between her safety and dmg because at the moment ahri has difficult time turning teamfights around like orianna or viktor  edit  my friend gives a good line about ahri at the moment   dash around and look pretty ,d02cmxj,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455656400.0,Vertigahri,206.0,0.0,556.0,4003.0,0.0

1954,1955,yeah  there s plenty of other things to nerf instead of that like her movespeed on her q or the cooldown on her ult i feel like she s relatively balanced  not too much damage  not too much utility  just a little too safe  which nerfs to the movespeed from her q would really hit  but so goes the way that riot likes to balance  nerf the things that are nt the problem and then soon after they nerf the actual problem while never reverting the original nerf then the champion sits in the gutter for a couple months before being given a negligible buff that riot states is more than enough ,d02f8d7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659845.0,VanishingBanshee,3.0,0.0,1.0,5222.0,0.0

1956,1957,one big thing you might find weird is what items to build since hots does nt have them i d tell you to check some guides on the champs you wan na play to start understanding the whole item builds and why x stat on x champ mechanic wise you should be decent enough if you already played a moba have a general knowledge of the meta and you should be fine  and do nt be afraid to experiment shit it helps imo ,d01qya5,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455616587.0,Rownarck,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0
1957,1958,played lol for 4 or 5 years and then switched to hots for about a year  other people have mentioned the cs  so i ll move on to something else there are a lot less early teamfights in lol usually  because there are a lot less objectives which puts a lot more emphasis on laning phase and your individual play in hots you had an objective spawning like every 2 or 3 minutes  so there were usually teamfights for those objectives in lol  while there are things you can do  you ll probably be laning for most of the first 15 minutes of the game especially early on in your career where there is less team emphasis on objectives  oh  and towers are way more important in lol than they are in hots ,d01xlh2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455635376.0,Taidaishar,1.0,0.0,455.0,1462.0,0.0

1963,1964,it s not like she had a few matchup and this makes them unplayable  ahri did nt had a single bad matchup before  if you played properly  it s exactly the right way to nerf her  tbh  even tho it will hurt my play on her a lot ,d02e04h,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455658231.0,IvanTKlasnic,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1964,1965,her movespeed from q and ult cooldown are the areas they should have considered nerfing i do nt think aspects of a champion that give them a potentially higher skillcap  such as ahri charming someone middash or the old proposed lee sin nerf that would have increased the cooldown of his w if he did nt use it on another player are wrong ways to nerf a champion ,d02d4t9,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455657068.0,Goorag,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1965,1966,i do nt think it s intended as a straight nerf so much as getting rid of a nonintuitive case  because almost every other cc works the nerfed way ahri s was one of the few exceptions ,d02oq98,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455674194.0,AncientSpark,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1966,1967,i agree that charm should still stop dashes however  i take issue with some of the other things you said  first  unless she s fed  ahri is not a burst mage her damage when compared with champions like leblanc is a joke she s really a rare breed of kiting mage in fact  you could argue that she s the only true kiting mage in the game possible exceptions are tf  karma  and ori as such  taking away kiting potential serves only to weaken her identity and seems utterly backwards  as you said  second  the change to ahri s charm that made it increase damage is what made me stop playing her i ca nt speak for everyone  but in my opinion this turned an exciting and engaging champion into a boring  binary  and just generally unfun one with that change in place  you have to open any engagement with a charm you do nt have to pick your moments at all did you hit your charm  if yes  go in it made ahri a burst mage  because if you could nt kill your target during that short damage boost period  you did nothing  to me  toning down the damage on charm a little would be a healthy change  edit  people are misunderstanding i know charm no longer gives bonus damage i do nt want it to come back because i think it ruined ahri ,d02is36,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664979.0,Shadowlink839,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1968,1969,honestly she was more fun with e amp than q movement speed because it required you to hit both your skillshots i wish they would take dmg off of her w and put it on the back end of q  making it dodgeable and requiring you to reposition ,d02m2lv,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455670132.0,TrickedFaith,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1969,1970,the change is supposed to make charm consistent with other types of cc in the first place and meant as a nerf secondary ,d02c3ct,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455655669.0,Zaddelz,71.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1970,1971,i really do nt understand why they re hitting a niche mechanic that good ahris make use of instead of just saying   ahri is too safe  raise her ult cooldown  1109580 gt  13010580  ,d02fn68,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455660417.0,NaneunDasiYeyo,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1976,1977,to be honest i really hated this interaction with charm it s one of the only cc spells in the game that does this and 95  of the time it s completely unintentional playing leblanc into ahri was such a pain in the ass  i m fine with it  because it ll work like every other cc in the game now the target hit by charm will end their dash and then walk towards ahri for the cc duration ,d02f7in,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659814.0,Cileth,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1978,1979,not only is it a bit of an iffy nerf vs people with dashes like lb since it s how to outplay it also has no impact at all on the rather large amount of matchups that do nt have a dash  i do nt know exactly what to nerf but i d say the fact she can 1000 most people is nt the problem it s that coupled with the fact she can build full assassin for catch  or go poke mage she has a bit too much utility tbh her e  3 dashes  and insane ms on q on a fairly spammable cd  i do nt think she s far from balanced but i do nt think this gets her closer it just makes a difference in a very small amount of matchups mid  and vs a decent amount of champions later in the game ,d02v3a4,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455684734.0,MaiLittlePwny,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1981,1982,the issue here i think is with how it works with ping values upwards to 100ms i ve seen a lot of players call bullshit on some dash interrupts or cancels or charms landing not interrupting properly  either the dash will go on cooldown even before you get some distance or you ll land your charm but the dash will still go through even if you hit it before they even started and be charmed after ,d02l2ep,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455668625.0,combaniguy,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
1982,1983,i do nt even know why they keep doing that  looks like they randomly get some part of a champion s kit and nerf because they have to nerf something without even think about it  ahri have problems  everyone now that  she s too safe while been so good bursting someone  and the point where she s supposedly to be weak and vulnerable well she is nt that much anymore because of the movespeed on q  seriously  triple dash  why put this movespeed  just why   but no  better nerf outplay potencialmake easy for someone hitted by e get away without been punished for that ,d02kf6n,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455667618.0,Hachi-B,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1984,1985,i was about to go make this thread  i m not the greatest ahri player that s ever lived but i ve played well over 1k games with her by now over the past few years and it s honestly such a big part of her kit for me it s what allows ahri to survive and possibly win against leblanc if you straight up play better  i do nt think removing counterplay is the correct way to nerf a champ rather than making her strengths weaker it s just making her even weaker to things she already struggles against  aka leblanc and diana  honestly i think they should make it so her w does less damage if charm is nt landed or make it so she does nt get her movespeed on q until she gets her ult so she s susceptible to early ganks  add ways for the enemy to outplay her do nt remove ways for her to outplay the enemy ,d02idv2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664365.0,Horizon96,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

1989,1990,in my opinion  they should just make it so that her skills do slightly less damage without hitting charm  and slightly more damage with hitting charm it d hit her roaming since it would be somewhat harder to clear waves  and it would actually reward you for hitting a good charm ,d02j8kn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455665687.0,ArdentSky,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

dark  dark works for the ninja thing  but her balance motif lends itself to the fighting type i think i d go darkfighting  pure fighting  or even psychicfighting  alistar  fighting  yeah  either this or normalfighting works  amumu  groundghost  works fine  though waterghost would be funny  not serious  p   anivia  iceflying  i mean  she s basically articuno anyway  annie  fire  fire or firedark  ashe  ice  do nt see anything wrong with this  azir  flyingground  cause he s a sandbird  geddit  bard  fairy  the new fairy typing fits bard perfectly  blitzcrank  steelelectric  most definitely  brand  fire  yep  braum  iceground  sure  caitlyn  steel  works for me steelnormal would be an interesting typing though haha  cassiopeia  poison  snakelady i guess you could go poisonrock too because reasons  but yeah  pure poison is perfectly fine  chogath  darkground  yeah  sure  corki  steelfire  i would personally go fireflying or steelflying  but steelfire works i suppose  darius  steelfighting  warrior plus armor equals steelfighting i guess  could have dark replace either if you wanted  diana  darkfairy  aside from being an awesome typing  it works pretty well for diana  dr mundo  normalpoison  love it  draven  normal  do nt let draven hear you call him normal though could also be a fighting type  ekko  normal  ekko is an interesting one his time shenanigans makes me want to say psychic  but he does nt actually have powers i think normal was a good call steel could have worked as well i think  elise  darkbug  yeah  evelynn  dark  yep  ezreal  psychic  hmmm i suppose psychic is good here  fiddlesticks  flying  i m a little confused by this one i get crows  but fiddlesticks is clearly a ghost type  p fiora  fighting  yep  fizz  water  of course  galio  flyingrock  yeah  gargoyles  gangplank  firewater  haha  i actually like that  garen  steelfighting  i think garen fits this type best out of the other champs you gave this type  gnar  normal  one badass normal can gnar s megaevolution be normaldragon  c  gragas  fightingpoison  works for me  graves  fire  may as well be  hecarim  ghost  yep  heimerdinger  steelelectric  yeah pure steel is fine too the magnemite line is starting to feel encroached upon haha  illaoi  fightingwater  this is fine  irelia  steelfighting  again  could just go single type fighting if you want otherwise it works  janna  normalflying  sure could also be a good contender for the elusive pure flying type  jarvan iv  fighting  what  no steel type for this guy  i jest  pure fighting is fine  jax  fighting  not sure where else you could go here  jayce  steelelectric  poor magnemite  jhin  darkgrass  eh  if you want to run with the flower motif then fine otherwise pure dark is good too  jinx  steelfire  i dunno about steel honestly i suppose it works  but you could also go pure fire  or even forego steel for normal or dark jinx is a bit of a tough one to type  kalista  ghost  ghost works for most shadow isles champs  and kalista might even make a great ghostfighting if you re not already sick of fighting types on this list haha  karma  psychic  pretty much  karthus  ghost  yeah  kassadin  dark  sure  katarina  steel  steel  dark  or darksteel would all work for kat  kayle  fireflying  yeah  this is fine  kennen  electric  kennen is pikachu confirmed  khazix  bug  works fine for kha  kindred  darkfairy  fits kindred s themes perfectly  kogmaw  poison  yeah  leblanc  psychic  yep  lee sin  fighting   sigh  yes  leona  firesteel  hell yes  lissandra  darkice  personally would just go ice  but dark is fine too  lucian  dark  because he s black  i think lucian strikes me as a special fighting type like lucario hell fightingsteel would work  lulu  fairy  lulu is the definition of a fairy type  lux  psychicfairy  as funny as i find this  it works for lux  haha  malphite  groundrock  because pokemon needs more terrible groundrock types but yeah  malzahar  dark  i would go for the darkpsychic here  maokai  grassghost  yeah  that suits maokai pretty well  master yi  fighting  yeah  miss fortune  fire  probably the best you ll get with mf  mordekaiser  steelghost  beautiful  morgana  darkflying  yeah sure  nami  water  fish  nasus  darkfire  hmmm  there are a few types nasus could be  but darkfire works fine i think  nautilus  darkwater  this or steelwater both make a lot of sense for nautilus  nidalee  grass  hell  i d go for normalgrass if you re bent on the grass type  nocturne  darkdark  you re funny but in all seriousness  darkghost makes a lot of sense for him  nunu  ice  sure  olaf  fightingice  huh i guess that makes sense actually  orianna  steelelectric  i actually think steelpsychic would fit oriana better  pantheon  steelfighting  steel does make sense  but i would still go pure fighting personally maybe its just me  poppy  steelfighting   sigh  i guess  quinn  flying  pure flying for quinn  well that s quite an honor i d go normalflying because i m boring  p rammus  ground  no more really needs to be said here  reksai  darkground  i like it  renekton  ground  sure  works fine  rengar  fighting  can we just make rengar normal so we do nt have so many damn fighting types  haha  or dark  i do nt care  _   riven  fighting  well i guess if you have to  i rumble  steelelectric  uhhhsteelfire instead  ryze  psychic  yeah  i guess that s the best you can do with ryze  sejuani  ice  yerp  shaco  dark  yerp  shen  darkfighting  i guess if ninjas have to be dark  shyvana  firedragon  oh finally  a dragon type  ao shin  please  you must restore balance  _   singed  poison  because he s toxic  right  sion  steelfire  heatran is starting to feel sad  sivir  normal  i suppose  skarner  rockbug  skarner skarner  skarner  sona  psychic  wynaut  soraka  psychicfairy  yus  swain  darkflying  extra yus  syndra  dark  yeah could be psychic too  but dark is fine  tahm kench  darkwater  river demon  yeah  makes sense  talon  steel  yeah  i m fine with this  taric  fairyrock  i should nt laugh  but i will anyway  teemo  grasspoison  nah  should obviously be darkfire lt  sgt  thresh  ghost  yep  tristana  fire  might as well  trundle  fightingice  ehhhh  could just as well be pure ice  tryndamere  fighting  sure  twisted fate  psychic  sure  twitch  poison  yep  udyr  fightingnormal  yeah  i suppose could be pure fighting too  urgot  darksteel  ya know  i ll take your word on this one i m not really sure what i d do with urgot  varus  dark  so edgy  vayne  dark  i do nt know steel maybe  vayne is another tough one  veigar  darkfairy   who are you calling a fairy   velkoz  dark  personally would add psychic or go pure psychic  vi  steelfighting  i mean i guess you have to at this point  viktor  steelelectric  probably the best you can do for victor  vladimir  psychic  not sure about anyone else  but i d think vlad is more of a dark type than a psychic type  volibear  normalelectric  sure iceelectric would be interesting if only because polarbear but normalelectric makes more sense haha  warwick  normal  or dark or normaldark i mean either way  wukong  fightingrock  makes sense for wukong  xerath  psychic  sure  xin zhao  fighting  sure  yasuo  fightingflying  sure  yorick  groundghost  i dig it  zac  poison  once again  sure  zed  darkfighting  see  i like this typing on zed if not on the other ninjas  ziggs  steelfire  personally think steel feels uneccessary i think ziggs is pure fire  zilean  psychic  seeing as there s no timelord type  this is the next best thing  zyra  psychicgrass  this typing works just fine on zyra  whew i ca nt believe i just did that thanks for giving me something fun to do for a while i wonder how many times a pokemon s typing goes back and forth between different

2014,2015,aatrox  dark   flying   fighting  unfortunately  blood magic  is nt a type  but just given his overall thematic and the existence of  drain punch   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikidrain_punch_  move    fighting seems like a better type than flying  although he d definitely be a candidate for levitate  or  bounce   ahri    psychic   fairyfire  charm is straight up  sweet kiss   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikisweet_kiss_  move    akali  dark   fighting    dark fits ninja pretty well but at the same time she s not just a shadowy ninja she s an

bulbapediabulbagardennetwikicofagrigus_  pok  c3  a9mon     ghost   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikidusclops_  pok  c3  a9mon    but amumu is less mysterious and ethereal and is definitively more corporeal which makes normal seem like a better subtype  than nothing at all   additionally normalghost gives amumu ridiculous resistances befitting such a tanky champion  anivia  iceflying  flying is purely thematic on her but in lieu of another type  such as psychic  i d say it s still a better fit than monotype ice  annie  fire   dark    regardless of 45 of her abilities being fire tibbers is some dark magic  and she is called the  dark  child  ashe  ice  got ta have some monotyping somewhere although given that she s just as much about shooting people as she is about ice an argument could be made for icefighting  azir    flying   ground  just because he looks like a bird does not make him a bird  and even if it did it would nt make him flying none of his kit is about flying  psychic would be a better secondary type  but i d wager monotype is probably best for our guardian of the sands  bard  fairy  yup blitzcrank  steelelectric  yup brand  fire  yup braum  ice   ground   steel  his ultimate is ice  not ground i d almost go for fairy or psychic for his defensive shields but steel typing and the fact his kit is all about a piece of metal lends intself towards steel  caitlyn

2081,2082,i ve tested a bit  and it looks like the best way to trigger it is to pick a ranged champion go to a krug camp  attack it  place a portal roughly where the bigger krug was and make him return to his camp by moving away from it  when the krug starts spazzing out over the portal  then you ve activated the glitch successfully if not  attack him again and reset his position again  this usually causes him to land into the portal again and start screwing up  hope this helps in testing  and sorry if it s already been found ,d0287se,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455650542.0,NormalNavi,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2156,2157,how a lane plays out is very different in league compared to hots  from what i know  in hots your goal in a lane is to just push the lane literally from the first minion wave in order to burn out the ammo on towers this makes it easier to push with a terror dk as you take less damage  in league  however  pushing the lane to the tower  which has endless ammo  and will attack you if you attack enemy heroes that sit near it  no matter how many minions you have   is nt recommended early game this is because you need gold to get stronger and last hitting minions is the main way the closer you get to the enemy base the more dangerous it will be to stay there and farm as you will attract a lot more attention  also the towers work in your favour as minions they kill are minions an enemy champion did nt get gold from  so in short  last hitting minions is your main goal  getting tier 1 tower is done when you plan on roaming a lot and helping others take down the tier 1s in other lanes this is when the transition from  laning phase  to  teamfightobjective phase  takes place  trying to keep this shorter so i ll stop here champions you might like might be annie  relatively easy burst mage   brand  combo burst mage  spells apply a debuff  other spells interact with it  and shen  a tankwarrior who dashes around and slashes people  has a mapwide teleportshield on an ally ,d0208bp,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455639529.0,roroi3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2167,2168,kassadin is pretty similar to artanis kass is has a target q  and w that resets his aa animation  so it s like artanis s w if you use it right after an auto attack   and his ult s a blink he s a bit more immobile  but that s because mobility is a big thing in league  for jaina  you may want to consider anivia anivia focuses around a  chilled  debuff as well and can have some crazy damage thanks to it  but is pretty manaheavy  also  it s worth noting that most of the stats you ll want you ll get through items rather than levels there are a few champs that get bonus stats in their kits and some with strong base damages  but ultimately items are the way to go and can define the game for you  so be careful what you pick ,d01zopp,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455638718.0,VacuumInhabitant,1.0,0.0,1.0,144.0,0.0

2169,2170,there are no champions in league that play like artanis jaina  on the other hand  has a playstyle that could be found in some mages you re likely gon na stalk the mid lane for a while  the problem is that league requires you to lasthit minions properly in order to get gold also  the xp you get is for you and you alone  no such concept as team xp  another thing  your spells wo nt level up automatically  you ll have to level them up  thus defining your playstyle at times   in addition  talentlike abilities do nt exist  you ll have to get acquainted with the item shop  basically  last hits and kills  gt  lotsa gold  gt  more items  gt  more faceroll  i m not going to bother you with objective gameplay  hots has that in droves   but league has a twist  you do nt have a mount  a few other pointers   bolt of the storm  flash it s on a gt  4mn cooldown  but you get it from level 1   positions in league are somewhat set in stone nowadays  learn that meta and understand it not immediately  but at the very least starting lv12 the thing you really need to know right now is  mid is a solo lane   get acquainted with the concepts of runes and masteries as they help amplify your power issue here is that fully unlocking all tiers is going to take a while   most importantly  enjoy being a noob and do nt play ranked as soon as you reach lv30  it s a trap unless you wan na be rank 50 or something or if you actually are a fast learner or if you just want to have fun  anyway  lots of resources are available i d recommend starting off w solomidnet guides and subscribing to rsummonerschool   i ve played both games  so i can actually give you more intel if needed ,d01zv74,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455638990.0,Algerian,1.0,0.0,1439.0,5264.0,0.0
2170,2171,imo the best way to get in to league is to either  a pick a champion you like and then spam play them in their best role  not jungle when your account does nt have runes  or b pick a role you want to learn and choose 23 champions you want to put time in for that role jungling is difficult because it s balanced around having a full rune pagemastery page  which you do nt get until you buy runes with ip and your account is highleveled enough for mastery s i got into league because i really wanted to play blitzcrank  i learned his best role was bot lane so i spammed him support for a bunch of games and eventually fell in love with the support role  slowly widening my champ pool as i played ,d023kvn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455644254.0,ShaquilleOHeal,1.0,0.0,770.0,13202.0,0.0

2295,2296,so today riot released the  planned venues for worlds 2016   http  wwwlolesportscomen_usarticles2016worldchampionshiphitsnorthamerica   and they ve finally decided to come to chicago the midwest has missed out on major esports events in the past  and i know many people in the chicagoland area who are beyond excited for the quarter finals to be held here in the windy city  but riot booked a venue with less than 4000 seats sure  the  chicago theater   https  enwikipediaorgwikichicago_theatre  is beautiful and iconic  but in a city of millions  in a region starving for a major esports event  limiting yourself to 3500 seats is absolutely ridiculous  i ca nt believe they d limit themselves to such a small venue  when there are many larger venues in the city  and many that are available during october 13th  16th  for example  the  allstate arena   https  enwikipediaorgwikiallstate_arena   in rosemont illinois  just outside of the city of chicago  holds between 16 and 18500 people the arena is also in an easily accessible area  without the major congestion of downtown chicago they have way more parking available  and they re serviced by multiple forms of public transit   and they re available for the quarter finals   http  wwwrosemontcomallstate   just shift over to october 2016  edit  allstate is just one example there are many venues in chicago with far more seats ,466d7w,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455680680.0,IrrelevantGeOff,302.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2317,2318,i think for most people  the facts you describe  are clear the problem with hit boxes is  that a good game will have hit boxes match the animation of characters and projectiles pretty closely and here lol is lightyears away from being a good game some skillshots have their hitbox being broader than the animation  some smaller some skillshots go wider than the animation some shorter some characters have massive hitboxes around them some have part of their animation going beyond then hitbox  the problem is not  that people don  t understand the concept of hitboxes it  s that hitboxes in lol are fucking inconsistent all over the place and that  s what makes people mad  edit  heroes of the storm have fe way better matching hitboxes for skills and characters so it definately can be done and it  s due to riot  s programming lacking a lot  that this problem exist in this dimension ,d027j61,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455649615.0,TeeTheSame,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2366,2367,this is actually a little inaccurate what you are showing as character hitboxes are actually their  clickboxes   they are still a good indicator of the actual hitbox  but they normally have a radius that is 2030 units larger than the actual hitbox  because of this  it makes it appear that the center of a projectile must hit the edge of the clickbox when in actuality the projectile s hitbox  which is almost always a line  only has to hit the hitbox on the edges this along with camera perspective and lag causes the  buggy  hitboxes in the game ,d01zvf8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455638999.0,FrankTheBoxMonster,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2373,2374,gon na be honest here  i know what you re trying to do but its not being explained very well  the very first visual representation kind of causes some confusion with the point you re trying to make  there are 2 very important components to champions   the hit box  generally a cylinder or a box that occupies space to detect collisions   the model  the visual representation of the champion  this part has no effect actual affect on the game  its just there to look pretty no one would like to see a bunch of cylinders running around on summoners rift ,d02ncna,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455672119.0,Exgaves,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
2374,2375,i suppose my big question is  how do you go about understanding all of the champions hitboxes  does it just come with time and experience  in that case  how do you have the capacity to memorize every champion hitbox since a lot of the champs are hardly even played anymore  i ve seen people hit skillshots in between what looks like impassible minions  does this mean that champ hitbox takes priority  or does it mean that champ has a bigger hitbox  what is the avg minion hitbox as well ,d022kkt,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455642865.0,Battlemuffins,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

2741,2742,here s my speculation  reginald tried something different and it appeared to fail through 4 weeks  their 53 record looked better than their play did until this past weekend  the team looked very similar to s5 summer with the exception of hauntzer and having a jungler  even if the sven was nt playing up to expectations you could everyone doubted each others  calls and fear overshadowed their team fighting  what happened in week 5  weldon does and in 1 week did what woodbuck did not appear to do over the previous 4 while their functions seemed to overlap in the most crucial part of what woodbuck was hired to do  fix communication and get the team on the same page as a traditional sports head coach does although i do not doubt that woodbuck did much behind the scenes that we did not see in legends  the results in week 5 speak loudly for themselves last weeks 20 was much less impressive than this week s 20  add to that woodbuck not having an indepth knowledge of the game  i think he said he was low silver  and his speech about not being the players  friend at his introduction  and i think he was a fish out of water and it must have rubbed the players the wrong way i m not blaming the players  woodbuck  or regi  but it looks like a test that did not work to everyone s satisfaction  i hope kc does well in his next job and that regi s next attempt works better for the team ultimately only tsm knows why kc did nt work out ,d025dbl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455646698.0,league_of_fail,8.0,0.0,1.0,15905.0,0.0

3246,3247,honestly  i hate ahri more than annie i ve always had problems with ahri annie i can handle you just poke her out of range and never get close enough to be hit by her skills all ahri has to do is land one skillshot to kill you or seriously chunk you down so you have to back and basically lose lane  which is made even worse by the fact that she has a spell with 3 huge dashes  allowing her to appear from any angle to hit her skillshot easily and her q is bs let s give her an extremely low cooldown spell that goes through minions without losing any damage  has good range  does true damage  is completely spammable  makes her ridiculously fast  heals her every now and then  can clear an entire minion wave  etc i ca nt even try to trade with her when it s down because she gets a crazy speed boost and if she hits me with charm  her q is back up so quick it does nt matter that it was down maybe i just have a hard time playing against her personally  but every time i do  she eventually pokes me a time or two and then uses her ult to quickly position herself where i ca nt dodge her charm and kills me without me able to do anything then next time her ult is up she goes bot and gets a double kill i hate ahri  as an ahri player  if you have any suggestions how to beat her as an immobile mage without a stun  only a root  please let me know ,d0217uq,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455640951.0,dillydadally,11.0,0.0,1.0,2065.0,0.0

3270,3271,let s take a look at this from two points of view  joe buys the minimum amount of rp to get what he wants every time if he wants to mystery gift  and he needs rp  he ll go buy 650 for  5 joe s cost to purchase a mystery skin this way  simply in terms of rp value per dollar  is  377  sam loves the game  and has plenty of money  but is a major tightwad he will never buy rp unless the bonus rp offer is active  and only then purchasing the  100 package  netting 17000 rp sam s equivalent cost to join this program is  288 per skin  so the numbers you gave are nt bad at all  assuming both players are interested in mystery skins and this program joe would probably buy in at  4 for a one time  one month  package  as it would be cheaper than buying  5 worth of rp sam will recognize the value in the 12 month package  and happily buy in   sarcasm incoming  so what do you do at riot op   ,d02vhg3,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455685482.0,Meanie40,1.0,0.0,16.0,4046.0,0.0

3339,3340,i feel like the difference is that niels has to carry for his team to win  in contrast forg1ven can approach a rather macro focused playstyle  because of strong players on all other positions that s why it s hard to compare those two  since they really have to play completely different styles  if i had to decide which one is better atm i d probably give the edge to niels  although i am a huge forg1ven fanboy the sole reason for this is niels mastery of kalista he plays arguably the best western kalista  and kalista is a power pick in this meta whereas forg1ven is a master on caitlyn  lucian and corki but wouldnt even dare to touch kalista imo this will be a huge problem later in playoffs but i still love to watch that guy play  his movements and his spacing  look like a fking script ,d023fcu,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455644044.0,Nintentea,4.0,0.0,1.0,22238.0,0.0

20078,20079,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,29.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0
20079,20080,this is why  generally speaking  teams  in traditional sports  pickfind a coach and have the coach build the team in the usual case of a team already existing  they let the coach make roster decisions if the coach handpicks the players  you have someone to goto when things are nt working out because of the simple fact that the coach built the team not every coach will work well with certain players and obviously  tsm was nt going to let kc get rid ofreplace players on their team it can be difficult to fit in a coach that works with such strong personalities that are in tsm hopefully tsm can find a new coach before katowice and all the best to kc ,d022we2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643325.0,tjfllo,4.0,0.0,756.0,4870.0,0.0

21699,21700,i think this only nerfs experienced ahri players newer ahri players do nt go for prediction charms so this wo nt change much in platinum or lower  i think they should reduce her safety and increase her dmg just a bit  in skillshots   make ulti cd longer or make q mov speed scaling with levels  also i would love to have less dmg in her w and a bit more in her skillshots maybe reduce w dmg and give charm dmg amp back  i think this is a bit weird nerf i think she is balanced but she just need few slight changes between her safety and dmg because at the moment ahri has difficult time turning teamfights around like orianna or viktor  edit  my friend gives a good line about ahri at the moment   dash around and look pretty ,d02cmxj,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455656400.0,Vertigahri,199.0,0.0,556.0,4003.0,0.0

21702,21703,if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to 80 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1812  lux binding 1511  anivia q 128  brand stun 86  leblanc chains 148 and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game ,d02hqy7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663412.0,Kagormund,33.0,0.0,1.0,231.0,0.0
21703,21704,this was ahri s tool against fizzleblanccorki removing it will most likely not harm ahri a lot but it will make these champions stronger in the match up  i still ca nt think of a reason why you would nt revert her q movespeed change to the original and give charm the amplification back  but hey  it s not like it was the most obvious way of balancing ahri after the change that made her broken and began the spiral of nerfs rito too stubborn ,d02hhia,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663031.0,Quaggsire,11.0,0.0,92.0,42644.0,0.0

21711,21712,what the fuck riot seriously ahri needs to be less safe  and have more weaknesses  gutting her charm s usability is not the way to go up ult  q  e cd or damage  lower movement speed  these are all ways to nerf anyways  i do nt think she s broken  just so balanced that she is so safe right now also her competitive usage is actually really low right now that it would be very disingenuous to say she s broken in anyway shape or form ,d02mw0d,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455671417.0,DepressedPepe,7.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,0.0
21712,21713,this is so sad actually balance changes that remove core gameplay is questionable why not reduce her base damages and increase scaling  why not just increase the charm cd if it s so problematic ahri gets too much love  in turn too much hate it s not the kit s fault if she has a dedicated player population winrates i think are naturally supposed to go up with more experience with the champ  just punish mistakes and reward good play  do nt go for a halfassed nerf ,d02jvfi,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455666757.0,knlwj,7.0,0.0,1.0,297.0,0.0
21714,21715,i was about to go make this thread  i m not the greatest ahri player that s ever lived but i ve played well over 1k games with her by now over the past few years and it s honestly such a big part of her kit for me it s what allows ahri to survive and possibly win against leblanc if you straight up play better  i do nt think removing counterplay is the correct way to nerf a champ rather than making her strengths weaker it s just making her even weaker to things she already struggles against  aka leblanc and diana  honestly i think they should make it so her w does less damage if charm is nt landed or make it so she does nt get her movespeed on q until she gets her ult so she s susceptible to early ganks  add ways for the enemy to outplay her do nt remove ways for her to outplay the enemy ,d02idv2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664365.0,Horizon96,4.0,0.0,49.0,1918.0,0.0

21717,21718,i agree that charm should still stop dashes however  i take issue with some of the other things you said  first  unless she s fed  ahri is not a burst mage her damage when compared with champions like leblanc is a joke she s really a rare breed of kiting mage in fact  you could argue that she s the only true kiting mage in the game possible exceptions are tf  karma  and ori as such  taking away kiting potential serves only to weaken her identity and seems utterly backwards  as you said  second  the change to ahri s charm that made it increase damage is what made me stop playing her i ca nt speak for everyone  but in my opinion this turned an exciting and engaging champion into a boring  binary  and just generally unfun one with that change in place  you have to open any engagement with a charm you do nt have to pick your moments at all did you hit your charm  if yes  go in it made ahri a burst mage  because if you could nt kill your target during that short damage boost period  you did nothing  to me  toning down the damage on charm a little would be a healthy change  edit  people are misunderstanding i know charm no longer gives bonus damage i do nt want it to come back because i think it ruined ahri ,d02is36,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664979.0,Shadowlink839,7.0,0.0,4.0,28.0,0.0
21730,21731,keep in mind ahri is being shaped as more of a kite mage  maybe they think she s too good at kiting with her ms q  three dashes and the ability to interrupt dashes  this is a way of hitting that without just changing the numbers  whether or not it is justified is another conversation but this is i think riot s reasoning ,d02eyla,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659484.0,Honk_If_Top_Comment,4.0,0.0,7.0,244717.0,1.0
21733,21734,i really do nt understand why they re hitting a niche mechanic that good ahris make use of instead of just saying   ahri is too safe  raise her ult cooldown  1109580 gt  13010580  ,d02fn68,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455660417.0,NaneunDasiYeyo,5.0,0.0,1.0,5578.0,0.0
21734,21735,the only main argument is  that the ahri vs leblanc matchup is harder that way but i dont quite see why thats a problem shouldnt some champions have bad matchups   she still got 3 dashes to escape and outplay  her charm still makes enemies unable to cast spells or control their champ  i get the whole  yeah  important part of the gameplay  it punishes other s mistakes  but charm still is hard cc after all other champs have hard cc that doesnt cancel dashes and still can punish mistakes  so  i just dont get it ahri still can punish  she still has hard cc  she still does damage and all her escape jumps when someone like lb tries to catch her out are still there i dont see the big problem here that explains the huge complaining on this sub,d02gjo9,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455661683.0,VoidValkon,3.0,0.0,6.0,12878.0,0.0
21735,21736,it s not like she had a few matchup and this makes them unplayable  ahri did nt had a single bad matchup before  if you played properly  it s exactly the right way to nerf her  tbh  even tho it will hurt my play on her a lot ,d02e04h,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455658231.0,IvanTKlasnic,3.0,0.0,26.0,6193.0,0.0
21741,21742,to be honest i really hated this interaction with charm it s one of the only cc spells in the game that does this and 95  of the time it s completely unintentional playing leblanc into ahri was such a pain in the ass  i m fine with it  because it ll work like every other cc in the game now the target hit by charm will end their dash and then walk towards ahri for the cc duration ,d02f7in,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659814.0,Cileth,1.0,0.0,983.0,1437.0,0.0

22908,22909,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,599.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0
22909,22910,skillshots also have a width  and if the skillshot edge touches the hitbox edge  it hits  for the most part  it s not center only on skillshots ,d0217nx,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455640944.0,NullAshton,129.0,0.0,4.0,3582.0,0.0
22910,22911,good job at explaning the general behaviour of hitboxes even tho you state your visualisation to be wip  i think it s already quite good you should consider posting this in  rsummonerschool   https  wwwredditcomrsummonerschool  when you re finished and satisfied with the actual video  since the topic is most important for people who are new to this and similar games ,d01z38y,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455637814.0,Caenen_,40.0,0.0,1.0,858.0,0.0

24200,24201,let s be honest here  reginald was the real head coach of tsm and probably always will be because tsm is his baby and he commands the most respect in the organization i feel like it would be worth it for him to hire some employees to help handle the business side so he can have more of a hand coaching his crown jewel league of legends team  them succeeding is definitely a very strong interest for tsm  and he is clearly the one for the job as far as someone to direct conversation  be the authoritative voice  and direct the team in learning how to improve  reginald is definitely the man for the job  he even has pretty good strategic understanding of the game ,d01pl8b,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455611269.0,-Basileus,154.0,0.0,1.0,19923.0,0.0

24213,24214,here s my speculation  reginald tried something different and it appeared to fail through 4 weeks  their 53 record looked better than their play did until this past weekend  the team looked very similar to s5 summer with the exception of hauntzer and having a jungler  even if the sven was nt playing up to expectations you could everyone doubted each others  calls and fear overshadowed their team fighting  what happened in week 5  weldon does and in 1 week did what woodbuck did not appear to do over the previous 4 while their functions seemed to overlap in the most crucial part of what woodbuck was hired to do  fix communication and get the team on the same page as a traditional sports head coach does although i do not doubt that woodbuck did much behind the scenes that we did not see in legends  the results in week 5 speak loudly for themselves last weeks 20 was much less impressive than this week s 20  add to that woodbuck not having an indepth knowledge of the game  i think he said he was low silver  and his speech about not being the players  friend at his introduction  and i think he was a fish out of water and it must have rubbed the players the wrong way i m not blaming the players  woodbuck  or regi  but it looks like a test that did not work to everyone s satisfaction  i hope kc does well in his next job and that regi s next attempt works better for the team ultimately only tsm knows why kc did nt work out ,d025dbl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455646698.0,league_of_fail,6.0,0.0,1.0,15905.0,0.0
24214,24215,andy and woodbuck both took a chance  andy on someone new to the scene over an experienced league coach loco and woodbuck on the esports scene sometimes it works out  but everything being smooth sailing as soon as someone steps foot in the scene is rare  maybe woodbuck could nt translate his coaching experience from traditional sport to esport as well as he thought he could  maybe they had more success with the approach of other members of the coaching staff maybe he was a super star head coach that brought in 20 week and got kicked out over a feud with a player like reddit hopes he turn out to be  i think the first is more likely  they took a chance  did their best  did nt work out  rather than some drummed up drama ,d027uyp,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455650061.0,ZenBull,6.0,0.0,1.0,921.0,0.0

25665,25666,ok  so since i m a huge pokemon nerd  i feel like reviewing this and explaining changes i d make and why soooohere we go  aatrox  darkflying  yep  ahri  psychicfire  sound s right  akali  dark  dark works for the ninja thing  but her balance motif lends itself to the fighting type i think i d go darkfighting  pure fighting  or even psychicfighting  alistar  fighting  yeah  either this or normalfighting works  amumu  groundghost  works fine  though waterghost would be funny  not serious  p   anivia  iceflying  i mean  she s basically articuno anyway  annie  fire  fire or firedark  ashe  ice  do nt see anything wrong with this  azir  flyingground  cause he s a sandbird  geddit  bard  fairy  the new fairy typing fits bard perfectly  blitzcrank  steelelectric  most definitely  brand  fire  yep  braum  iceground  sure  caitlyn  steel  works for me steelnormal would be an interesting typing though haha  cassiopeia  poison  snakelady i guess you could go poisonrock too because reasons  but yeah  pure poison is perfectly fine  chogath  darkground  yeah  sure  corki  steelfire  i would personally go fireflying or steelflying  but steelfire works i suppose  darius  steelfighting  warrior plus armor equals steelfighting i guess  could have dark replace either if you wanted  diana  darkfairy  aside from being an awesome typing  it works pretty well for diana  dr mundo  normalpoison  love it  draven  normal  do nt let draven hear you call him normal though could also be a fighting type  ekko  normal  ekko is an interesting one his time shenanigans makes me want to say psychic  but he does nt actually have powers i think normal was a good call steel could have worked as well i think  elise  darkbug  yeah  evelynn  dark  yep  ezreal  psychic  hmmm i suppose psychic is good here  fiddlesticks  flying  i m a little confused by this one i get crows  but fiddlesticks is clearly a ghost type  p fiora  fighting  yep  fizz  water  of course  galio  flyingrock  yeah  gargoyles  gangplank  firewater  haha  i actually like that  garen  steelfighting  i think garen fits this type best out of the other champs you gave this type  gnar  normal  one badass normal can gnar s megaevolution be normaldragon  c  gragas  fightingpoison  works for me  graves  fire  may as well be  hecarim  ghost  yep  heimerdinger  steelelectric  yeah pure steel is fine too the magnemite line is starting to feel encroached upon haha  illaoi  fightingwater  this is fine  irelia  steelfighting  again  could just go single type fighting if you want otherwise it works  janna  normalflying  sure could also be a good contender for the elusive pure flying type  jarvan iv  fighting  what  no steel type for this guy  i jest  pure fighting is fine  jax  fighting  not sure where else you could go here  jayce  steelelectric  poor magnemite  jhin  darkgrass  eh  if you want to run with the flower motif then fine otherwise pure dark is good too  jinx  steelfire  i dunno about steel honestly i suppose it works  but you could also go pure fire  or even forego steel for normal or dark jinx is a bit of a tough one to type  kalista  ghost  ghost works for most shadow isles champs  and kalista might even make a great ghostfighting if you re not already sick of fighting types on this list haha  karma  psychic  pretty much  karthus  ghost  yeah  kassadin  dark  sure  katarina  steel  steel  dark  or darksteel would all work for kat  kayle  fireflying  yeah  this is fine  kennen  electric  kennen is pikachu confirmed  khazix  bug  works fine for kha  kindred  darkfairy  fits kindred s themes perfectly  kogmaw  poison  yeah  leblanc  psychic  yep  lee sin  fighting   sigh  yes  leona  firesteel  hell yes  lissandra  darkice  personally would just go ice  but dark is fine too  lucian  dark  because he s black  i think lucian strikes me as a special fighting type like lucario hell fightingsteel would work  lulu  fairy  lulu is the definition of a fairy type  lux  psychicfairy  as funny as i find this  it works for lux  haha  malphite  groundrock  because pokemon needs more terrible groundrock types but yeah  malzahar  dark  i would go for the darkpsychic here  maokai  grassghost  yeah  that suits maokai pretty well  master yi  fighting  yeah  miss fortune  fire  probably the best you ll get with mf  mordekaiser  steelghost  beautiful  morgana  darkflying  yeah sure  nami  water  fish  nasus  darkfire  hmmm  there are a few types nasus could be  but darkfire works fine i think  nautilus  darkwater  this or steelwater both make a lot of sense for nautilus  nidalee  grass  hell  i d go for normalgrass if you re bent on the grass type  nocturne  darkdark  you re funny but in all seriousness  darkghost makes a lot of sense for him  nunu  ice  sure  olaf  fightingice  huh i guess that makes sense actually  orianna  steelelectric  i actually think steelpsychic would fit oriana better  pantheon  steelfighting  steel does make sense  but i would still go pure fighting personally maybe its just me  poppy  steelfighting   sigh  i guess  quinn  flying  pure flying for quinn  well that s quite an honor i d go normalflying because i m boring  p rammus  ground  no more really needs to be said here  reksai  darkground  i like it  renekton  ground  sure  works fine  rengar  fighting  can we just make rengar normal so we do nt have so many damn fighting types  haha  or dark  i do nt care  _   riven  fighting  well i guess if you have to  i rumble  steelelectric  uhhhsteelfire instead  ryze  psychic  yeah  i guess that s the best you can do with ryze  sejuani  ice  yerp  shaco  dark  yerp  shen  darkfighting  i guess if ninjas have to be dark  shyvana  firedragon  oh finally  a dragon type  ao shin  please  you must restore balance  _   singed  poison  because he s toxic  right  sion  steelfire  heatran is starting to feel sad  sivir  normal  i suppose  skarner  rockbug  skarner skarner  skarner  sona  psychic  wynaut  soraka  psychicfairy  yus  swain  darkflying  extra yus  syndra  dark  yeah could be psychic too  but dark is fine  tahm kench  darkwater  river demon  yeah  makes sense  talon  steel  yeah  i m fine with this  taric  fairyrock  i should nt laugh  but i will anyway  teemo  grasspoison  nah  should obviously be darkfire lt  sgt  thresh  ghost  yep  tristana  fire  might as well  trundle  fightingice  ehhhh  could just as well be pure ice  tryndamere  fighting  sure  twisted fate  psychic  sure  twitch  poison  yep  udyr  fightingnormal  yeah  i suppose could be pure fighting too  urgot  darksteel  ya know  i ll take your word on this one i m not really sure what i d do with urgot  varus  dark  so edgy  vayne  dark  i do nt know steel maybe  vayne is another tough one  veigar  darkfairy   who are you calling a fairy   velkoz  dark  personally would add psychic or go pure psychic  vi  steelfighting  i mean i guess you have to at this point  viktor  steelelectric  probably the best you can do for victor  vladimir  psychic  not sure about anyone else  but i d think vlad is more of a dark type than a psychic type  volibear  normalelectric  sure iceelectric would be interesting if only because polarbear but normalelectric makes more sense haha  warwick  normal  or dark or normaldark i mean either way  wukong  fightingrock  makes sense for wukong  xerath  psychic  sure  xin zhao  fighting  sure  yasuo  fightingflying  sure  yorick  groundghost  i dig it  zac  poison  once again  sure  zed  darkfighting  see  i like this typing on zed if not on the other ninjas  ziggs  steelfire  personally think steel feels uneccessary i think ziggs is pure fire  zilean  psychic  seeing as there s no timelord type  this is the next best thing  zyra  psychicgrass  this typing works just fine on zyra  whew i ca nt believe i just did that thanks for giving me something fun to do for a while i wonder how many times a pokemon s typing goes back and forth between different people when in development huh  edit  punctuation and stuffs  also want to make it clear i appreciate the thought and effort op put into the original post i just have fun going back and forth with

25672,25673,aatrox  dark   flying   fighting  unfortunately  blood magic  is nt a type  but just given his overall thematic and the existence of  drain punch   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikidrain_punch_  move    fighting seems like a better type than flying  although he d definitely be a candidate for levitate  or  bounce   ahri    psychic   fairyfire  charm is straight up  sweet kiss   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikisweet_kiss_  move    akali  dark   fighting    dark fits ninja pretty well but at the same time she s not just a shadowy ninja she s an assassin not to mention mono dark does nt really suit the theme of  balance   alistar  fighting  yeah do nt see why this does nt work perfectly  although he could almost be fightingground  amumu    ground   normalghost  there s nothing particularly ground about amumu  and the only  mummy  pokemon are  all   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikiyamask_  pok  c3  a9mon     mono   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikicofagrigus_  pok  c3  a9mon     ghost   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikidusclops_  pok  c3  a9mon    but amumu is less mysterious and ethereal and is definitively more corporeal which makes normal seem like a better subtype  than nothing at all   additionally normalghost gives amumu ridiculous resistances befitting such a tanky champion  anivia  iceflying  flying is purely thematic on her but in lieu of another type  such as psychic  i d say it s still a better fit than monotype ice  annie  fire   dark    regardless of 45 of her abilities being fire tibbers is some dark magic  and she is called the  dark  child  ashe  ice  got ta have some monotyping somewhere although given that she s just as much about shooting people as she is about ice an argument could be made for icefighting  azir    flying   ground  just because he looks like a bird does not make him a bird  and even if it did it would nt make him flying none of his kit is about flying  psychic would be a better secondary type  but i d wager monotype is probably best for our guardian of the sands  bard  fairy  yup blitzcrank  steelelectric  yup brand  fire  yup braum  ice   ground   steel  his ultimate is ice  not ground i d almost go for fairy or psychic for his defensive shields but steel typing and the fact his kit is all about a piece of metal lends intself towards steel  caitlyn  steel  as much as i hate it  steel is by far the best fit  especially because of her traps  cassiopeia  poison  yep chogath  darkground  for other void champs i d lean towards psychic as a subtype  but this fits cho perfectly  corki  steelfire  yup darius  steelfighting  yup diana  darkfairy  yup dr mundo    normal   fightingpoison  mundo smash  draven    normal   fighting  he s got ta be fighting  ekko  normal   psychic    someone said he should be psychic why not both  elise  darkbug  yup evelynn  dark  probably the only monotype dark i d say  ezreal  psychic  psychic  fairy  or psychicfairy  fiddlesticks    flying   dark   ghost    i mean he has  dark wind  and he s a possessed scarecrow he could use flying type moves but he sure as heck is nt flying  fiora  fighting   steel    if caitlyn is steel  fiora is definitely steel  fizz  water  yup galio  flyingrock  yup gangplank  fire   water   steel  if for nothing else but his ultimate  garen  steelfighting  sword fighter same as fiora  gnar    normal   fighting  cmon he s almost literally a cubone  gragas  fighting   poison   water  as much as i d like to say alcohol is poison he does damage by splashing people with it  not poisoning people with it  graves  fire   steel    much like gangplank he s a tanky guy with bullets and explosions  hecarim  ghost   fighting    he s just as much about kicking your face in as he is spooking you to death  heimerdinger  steelelectric  that  or just electric with steel moves  illaoi  fighting   water   ghost  as tempting as it is to have tentacles be water  they re not just any tentacles  they re spirit tentacles so i d say ghost  or maybe psychic or dark depending on your interpretation  irelia  steelpsychic  will of the blades and all it s right there in the name  janna    normal   flying  i m actually in favor of making her the unique mono flying  jarvan iv  fighting   ground    i really feel like he needs something for the cataclysm  jax  fighting  yup jayce    steel   fightingelectric  i kinda wan na say fightingelectric for diversity s sake  and also to emphasis his more offensive and less defensive nature  jhin    dark   steel   grass   psychic  dark is not evil  and even then  jhin is about 2 things  guns and magic if it were nt so light themed  i d have even gone with fairy instead  jinx  steelfire  100  get behind this  kalista  ghost   dark    shadow isles is 100  ghost  and what better thing to fight ghosts than a ghost dark  karma  psychic  maybe fairy  karthus  ghost  yup kassadin  darkpsychic  teleport is too psychic for him not to have it  katarina    steel   dark  dark type with steel moves too much of her stuff is magical to make her steel without making her dark  kayle  fire   flying   fairy  fairy is the closest thing to a holy type we have  kennen  electric  yup khazix  bug   dark    khazix s 2 defining characteristics are being a void bug i mean he has his void spikes after all  kindred  darkfairy  yup kogmaw  poison   bug    i know it s not what most people think of when they think bug  but kogmaw definitely fits the bill he is a caterpillar afterall  leblanc  psychic  yup lee sin  fighting  lee sin could practically be psychic  but his psychic moveset would be limited leona    fire   fairysteel  light is a fairy thing now  lissandra    dark   ice  dark is not evil all her kit is ice  just ice  lucian  dark   fighting    put an emphasis on the physicality of his combat  lulu  fairy  lulu is the definition of a fairy type  lux  psychicfairy  not so sure about psychic but no reason not to be  malphite  groundrock  as suggested  perhaps malphite could just be rock instead of rock ground  but he really is both  malzahar  dark   psychic    malz definitely needs a bit extra beyond just dark  maokai  grassghost  yup master yi  fighting  yup miss fortune    fire   fighting  fire and explosions are nt really her thing  all she s got is bullets and technically impure shots would be poison  mordekaiser  steelghost  mordekaiser es numero uno  morgana  dark   flying    wings    flying  nami  water  yup  nasus  dark   fire   ghost  ascendancy and  spirit  fire i mean it could go either way  nautilus    dark   steelwater  in a vacuum i d probably leave him as dark but we ve got enough dark on this list  nidalee  grass  yup nocturne  dark   ghost    yes yes darkness  nunu  ice  yup olaf  fightingice  yup orianna  steel   electric    pure steel with some steel special moves  pantheon    steel   fighting  he s far too naked to be steel  poppy  steelfighting  yup quinn  flying   fighting    if anyone is pure flying it s janna  rammus  ground  okay reksai  darkground  yup renekton    ground   fighting  his theme is that he s always mad how is he not fighting  rengar  fighting  yup riven    fighting   steel   flying    perfect opportunity for flying  rumble  steel   electric   fire  2 fire moves gt  1 electric  ryze  psychic  yup sejuani  ice   fighting    winter s claw after all  shaco  dark   poison    he s totes got poisons  shen  dark   fighting   psychic  there s a greater emphasis on twilight for the new shen  shyvana  firedragon  yup could almost get away with not being fire even  maybe fighting  singed  poison  yup sion  steel   ghost    none of his stuff is firey  that s all magic  sivir    normal   fighting  normal is definitely underrepresented on this list

26164,26165,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,343.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

26167,26168,this has already been posted before as well as the reproduction steps i tried it and it s hit or miss but if you get the hang of it  you can produce it most of the time what happens is when the portal gets stuck in a wall pushed by a jungle monster  it will summon invisible voidlings every half a second and will go to the nearest lane with high ms small and large visible voidlings will still appear regularly the invisible voidlings will try to follow  and attack  minions but will not do damage nor expire if they do nt have any minions to target  they will clump to the nearest turret or inhibitor  blocking it effectively that your melee minions ca nt even attack it  successfully doing it one time can block a few minions but doing it more than twice can block an entire lane if the enemy inhibitor is down  invisible voidlings might even block the spawn areas and in some occasions spread on other lanes  when coming from mid  of course you can do this on other lanes to start with  ,d01sspe,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455624014.0,necromimi,72.0,0.0,1693.0,1585.0,0.0

26410,26411,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,344.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

26413,26414,this has already been posted before as well as the reproduction steps i tried it and it s hit or miss but if you get the hang of it  you can produce it most of the time what happens is when the portal gets stuck in a wall pushed by a jungle monster  it will summon invisible voidlings every half a second and will go to the nearest lane with high ms small and large visible voidlings will still appear regularly the invisible voidlings will try to follow  and attack  minions but will not do damage nor expire if they do nt have any minions to target  they will clump to the nearest turret or inhibitor  blocking it effectively that your melee minions ca nt even attack it  successfully doing it one time can block a few minions but doing it more than twice can block an entire lane if the enemy inhibitor is down  invisible voidlings might even block the spawn areas and in some occasions spread on other lanes  when coming from mid  of course you can do this on other lanes to start with  ,d01sspe,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455624014.0,necromimi,73.0,0.0,1693.0,1585.0,0.0

38759,38760,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,30.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0
38760,38761,this is why  generally speaking  teams  in traditional sports  pickfind a coach and have the coach build the team in the usual case of a team already existing  they let the coach make roster decisions if the coach handpicks the players  you have someone to goto when things are nt working out because of the simple fact that the coach built the team not every coach will work well with certain players and obviously  tsm was nt going to let kc get rid ofreplace players on their team it can be difficult to fit in a coach that works with such strong personalities that are in tsm hopefully tsm can find a new coach before katowice and all the best to kc ,d022we2,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643325.0,tjfllo,6.0,0.0,756.0,4870.0,0.0

38799,38800,this is starting to become laughable at best  downright dumbfounding at a frequent pace  tsm needs to find another reginald someone with the same level of command for respect and attention sure regi was a good player in his day so at some level that plays a role in what he is able to accomplish when he is around the team  but honestly you just need someone that wont cut corners or try to foster positive vibes with these kids  fuck all of the lets be homies bullshit and kumbaya ass seminars for character growth hire someone for that role and dont call them a coach this specific set of players consist of a jungler that knows he can carry  a mid laner that knows he can 2v8 in na at any given time  an adc that knows that his mechanics are at all times in the top 1  of pro league  a top laner that has a chip on his shoulder to prove he s not just  tsm s top laner   despite being the most consistent on the team thus far  and a support that knows he can orchestrate the team efficiently in midlate game  all you need is a fucking hype man someone that will boost their egos when its called for a bully someone that will shit on them and call them out when they are fucking up the team s flow leave jarge as the strategic coach he s goodsolid filler for plugging in the information and direction this team needs when they themselves get in the way of their own skill parth is a great analyst he feeds them matchup intell and scouting reports or whatever the fuck he does  if you hadnt realized by now im going off of just a blanketed assumption of what these guys contribute to the team   this team needs someone that will agressively exude passion and harshly inflict criticism there isnt a personality on this team from what i know that will crumble from some assertive alpha male kc had the right idea about being the dominant force on the team but it turned out that he couldnt mark his territory i assume  telling this group of guys to  fake the funk  after barely beating some shitters  yes  im calling echo fox shitters in this context because despite their pr and pc bullshit tsm wanted to say it themselves  was probably the icing on the cake attempting to further neuter some wounded dire wolves like they no doubt feel they are is grounds for being thrown to the wall you need someone to come in after a game saying  god damn bjerg murder that fucking mid lane some more    or  who called for that last baron  you know you absolutely fucked us right  but you did manage good vision pathing for the set up so just   tsm is the ultimate  i am a fucking legend  team its in the fucking name this team is meant to individually shit on the enemy for the sake of the team yes the meta doesnt fit their traditional playstyle of bodying bitches with raw skill  or funneling resources into the carry  but at the absolute apex of what this team represents  its swagger  arrogance  and the pursuit of  1v1mebro  ,d02sjrb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455680247.0,Tonelix,5.0,0.0,1.0,38.0,0.0

38808,38809,i still think it s a huge mistake to fire a coach who has only been with the org for a few months just because he is nt up to par yet if that is literally the only reason he was being let go then why are the players also not being let go  they definitely had nt been performing to expectation until their game against clg  which still was nt mind blowing  makes me wonder if this was nt another instance of regi trying to step in too much and undermining the authority of kc there s a reason the owners of traditional sports are nt involved in the coaching of the team at all or it could be the players  having no background in traditional sports  got their ego s bruised a bit by the coaching methods that kc brought and tucked their tails and went to papa regi or  he could have legit just been bad at his job as the announcement implies  i think the most likely scenario is that it was a combination of all of those situations  but i m not privy to any inside information  he could have stolen leena s candy bar for all i know  i do want to reiterate  regi should not  in any way  be involved in the coaching of the team if he wants his players to respect a hired coach he should either coach the team  or own the team if you ve hired someone to coach  let them coach if they become ineffective  fire them  hire a new coach  but do not step in and undermine their authority ,d02rffn,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455678400.0,Darktire,3.0,0.0,29.0,7632.0,0.0

40848,40849,if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to 80 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1812  lux binding 1511  anivia q 128  brand stun 86  leblanc chains 148 and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game ,d02hqy7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663412.0,Kagormund,32.0,0.0,1.0,231.0,0.0

40863,40864,i agree that charm should still stop dashes however  i take issue with some of the other things you said  first  unless she s fed  ahri is not a burst mage her damage when compared with champions like leblanc is a joke she s really a rare breed of kiting mage in fact  you could argue that she s the only true kiting mage in the game possible exceptions are tf  karma  and ori as such  taking away kiting potential serves only to weaken her identity and seems utterly backwards  as you said  second  the change to ahri s charm that made it increase damage is what made me stop playing her i ca nt speak for everyone  but in my opinion this turned an exciting and engaging champion into a boring  binary  and just generally unfun one with that change in place  you have to open any engagement with a charm you do nt have to pick your moments at all did you hit your charm  if yes  go in it made ahri a burst mage  because if you could nt kill your target during that short damage boost period  you did nothing  to me  toning down the damage on charm a little would be a healthy change  edit  people are misunderstanding i know charm no longer gives bonus damage i do nt want it to come back because i think it ruined ahri ,d02is36,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664979.0,Shadowlink839,5.0,0.0,4.0,28.0,0.0

40878,40879,imo  the way to nerf ahri is buffing the power of her skillshots while nerfing the power of her w and r when i started to get into ahri i was shocked by how unreliant she actually is on hitting her skillshots what  should  be a high skillcap champion can just bum rush an adc with r while spamming w with 40  cdr and just assassinate them without using any other spells  without any room for outplay on the victim s part unless they can burst her down faster than she bursts them down  which is really fast  even without skillshots   add ignite to the mix for more brainless  nonskillshot burst  ahri mains will always circle jerk that she s hard to play and you need to good at hitting skillshots to be good at ahri while you do need to be good with skillshots to get the best out of her  as someone who s awful at them  i can testify to the fact that you absolutely do nt need it to get results on ahri   http  iimgurcomtmkvcappng   i love playing her for that reason but it s also awful to play against and highly counterintuitive when her kit was clearly meant to require her to hit her skillshots to do well  rather than just being an additional reward while her w and r are already more than enough on their own in so many situations  i think her r is basically fine  on its own it s not a problem  the main reason it looks like an issue is that the gap closing is such an easy enabler for her w  which is the real problem imo w requires a nerf to either the damage or the cooldown  or a mix of both making it harder to assassinate targets with 23 r charges and 2 w s makes it more important for her to be able to land her skillshots  one or both of which can receive small buffs to help keep her overall power the same  so long as you re playing mechanically well and not just mashing r and w in the general direction of the person you want to kill  my thoughts on riot s nerf is that it s strange to nerf one of her skillshots rather than hitting her unhealthy gameplay pattern  but the nerf itself actually does make a lot of sense all things considered  it s not a displacement cc so it should nt cancel out dashes i do nt think they re aiming to directly nerf ahri s power with that change as much as they re just trying to make their game more consistent but i think ahri  is  a champion they should take a closer look at  she really needs some power shifts in her kit ,d02mhwd,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455670797.0,VaporaDark,4.0,0.0,975.0,9420.0,0.0

42349,42350,biggest change for me when i played hots after playing lol for years was not buying items i couldnt get over it idk why but it made the game feel simple and characters were only allowed one role or so it felt when i played at release have nt gone back they have recommended builds but i would also recommend looking them up for the current season all of the 450 champs are pretty decent especially poppy she was recently reworked so i d recommend getting them first do not buy runes until you re sumoner level 20 and can buy tier 3 runes otherwise you re wasting ip  influence points you gain from games   another thing is lanes i dont recall lanes being much of a thing in hots  but the na meta rn is a solo top lane which is generally a tankybruiser charecter with a jungle also will most likely be tankybruiser but they do have assassin jungles as well  then you got solo mid which is generally a ranged ap champ finally on bottom you got 2 champs 1  adc  attack damage carry  theyre job is to get fed and stack a bunch of ad  attack speed and crit chance the other on bottom is the support  generally a champ with good crowd control or healing abilities  or both  sorry for wall of text i can just think of a lot of little tips for someone starting ,d01r3dg,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455617183.0,daogrande,7.0,0.0,309.0,1071.0,0.0

44989,44990,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,605.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0

71856,71857,honestly  i hate ahri more than annie i ve always had problems with ahri annie i can handle you just poke her out of range and never get close enough to be hit by her skills all ahri has to do is land one skillshot to kill you or seriously chunk you down so you have to back and basically lose lane  which is made even worse by the fact that she has a spell with 3 huge dashes  allowing her to appear from any angle to hit her skillshot easily and her q is bs let s give her an extremely low cooldown spell that goes through minions without losing any damage  has good range  does true damage  is completely spammable  makes her ridiculously fast  heals her every now and then  can clear an entire minion wave  etc i ca nt even try to trade with her when it s down because she gets a crazy speed boost and if she hits me with charm  her q is back up so quick it does nt matter that it was down maybe i just have a hard time playing against her personally  but every time i do  she eventually pokes me a time or two and then uses her ult to quickly position herself where i ca nt dodge her charm and kills me without me able to do anything then next time her ult is up she goes bot and gets a double kill i hate ahri  as an ahri player  if you have any suggestions how to beat her as an immobile mage without a stun  only a root  please let me know ,d0217uq,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455640951.0,dillydadally,13.0,0.0,1.0,2065.0,0.0

90325,90326,i feel like the difference is that niels has to carry for his team to win  in contrast forg1ven can approach a rather macro focused playstyle  because of strong players on all other positions that s why it s hard to compare those two  since they really have to play completely different styles  if i had to decide which one is better atm i d probably give the edge to niels  although i am a huge forg1ven fanboy the sole reason for this is niels mastery of kalista he plays arguably the best western kalista  and kalista is a power pick in this meta whereas forg1ven is a master on caitlyn  lucian and corki but wouldnt even dare to touch kalista imo this will be a huge problem later in playoffs but i still love to watch that guy play  his movements and his spacing  look like a fking script ,d023fcu,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455644044.0,Nintentea,3.0,0.0,1.0,22238.0,0.0

91522,91523,this is starting to become laughable at best  downright dumbfounding at a frequent pace  tsm needs to find another reginald someone with the same level of command for respect and attention sure regi was a good player in his day so at some level that plays a role in what he is able to accomplish when he is around the team  but honestly you just need someone that wont cut corners or try to foster positive vibes with these kids  fuck all of the lets be homies bullshit and kumbaya ass seminars for character growth hire someone for that role and dont call them a coach this specific set of players consist of a jungler that knows he can carry  a mid laner that knows he can 2v8 in na at any given time  an adc that knows that his mechanics are at all times in the top 1  of pro league  a top laner that has a chip on his shoulder to prove he s not just  tsm s top laner   despite being the most consistent on the team thus far  and a support that knows he can orchestrate the team efficiently in midlate game  all you need is a fucking hype man someone that will boost their egos when its called for a bully someone that will shit on them and call them out when they are fucking up the team s flow leave jarge as the strategic coach he s goodsolid filler for plugging in the information and direction this team needs when they themselves get in the way of their own skill parth is a great analyst he feeds them matchup intell and scouting reports or whatever the fuck he does  if you hadnt realized by now im going off of just a blanketed assumption of what these guys contribute to the team   this team needs someone that will agressively exude passion and harshly inflict criticism there isnt a personality on this team from what i know that will crumble from some assertive alpha male kc had the right idea about being the dominant force on the team but it turned out that he couldnt mark his territory i assume  telling this group of guys to  fake the funk  after barely beating some shitters  yes  im calling echo fox shitters in this context because despite their pr and pc bullshit tsm wanted to say it themselves  was probably the icing on the cake attempting to further neuter some wounded dire wolves like they no doubt feel they are is grounds for being thrown to the wall you need someone to come in after a game saying  god damn bjerg murder that fucking mid lane some more    or  who called for that last baron  you know you absolutely fucked us right  but you did manage good vision pathing for the set up so just   tsm is the ultimate  i am a fucking legend  team its in the fucking name this team is meant to individually shit on the enemy for the sake of the team yes the meta doesnt fit their traditional playstyle of bodying bitches with raw skill  or funneling resources into the carry  but at the absolute apex of what this team represents  its swagger  arrogance  and the pursuit of  1v1mebro  ,d02sjrb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455680247.0,Tonelix,6.0,0.0,1.0,38.0,0.0

93519,93520,i think this only nerfs experienced ahri players newer ahri players do nt go for prediction charms so this wo nt change much in platinum or lower  i think they should reduce her safety and increase her dmg just a bit  in skillshots   make ulti cd longer or make q mov speed scaling with levels  also i would love to have less dmg in her w and a bit more in her skillshots maybe reduce w dmg and give charm dmg amp back  i think this is a bit weird nerf i think she is balanced but she just need few slight changes between her safety and dmg because at the moment ahri has difficult time turning teamfights around like orianna or viktor  edit  my friend gives a good line about ahri at the moment   dash around and look pretty ,d02cmxj,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455656400.0,Vertigahri,202.0,0.0,556.0,4003.0,0.0

93521,93522,if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to 80 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1812  lux binding 1511  anivia q 128  brand stun 86  leblanc chains 148 and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game ,d02hqy7,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663412.0,Kagormund,38.0,0.0,1.0,231.0,0.0

93536,93537,i agree that charm should still stop dashes however  i take issue with some of the other things you said  first  unless she s fed  ahri is not a burst mage her damage when compared with champions like leblanc is a joke she s really a rare breed of kiting mage in fact  you could argue that she s the only true kiting mage in the game possible exceptions are tf  karma  and ori as such  taking away kiting potential serves only to weaken her identity and seems utterly backwards  as you said  second  the change to ahri s charm that made it increase damage is what made me stop playing her i ca nt speak for everyone  but in my opinion this turned an exciting and engaging champion into a boring  binary  and just generally unfun one with that change in place  you have to open any engagement with a charm you do nt have to pick your moments at all did you hit your charm  if yes  go in it made ahri a burst mage  because if you could nt kill your target during that short damage boost period  you did nothing  to me  toning down the damage on charm a little would be a healthy change  edit  people are misunderstanding i know charm no longer gives bonus damage i do nt want it to come back because i think it ruined ahri ,d02is36,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664979.0,Shadowlink839,8.0,0.0,4.0,28.0,0.0
93550,93551,at its core  the change is a bug fix to make it consistent with similar effects  charm is a taunt  not a displacement effect and by definition it should not interrupt movement  turning a blind eye to strange interactions is fine when a champion is weak  but ahri has been a solid pick for years ,d02n12z,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455671633.0,SailorMint,2.0,0.0,1.0,16985.0,0.0

93627,93628,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,35.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0

95763,95764,so a few things that help me  cause i get upset too but have worked on it the new queue system has helped this a ton because now i do nt need to worry about playing something i dont want to play  from best advise and down  1 play to have fun so many people forget this if you re queuing up just to prove to yourself or anyone else that you can do well then you ve got a bigger issue  2 play music and ignore negative comments  3 understand that if you really are a much better player you will eventually get out of the current rank and eventually be placed where you need to be  4 number two is important and while it may seem like you ve wasted 30 mins because you ve lost due to someone incompetence it should be a learning experience becausing losing is inevitable there is no reason to not try and at least make the best of every situation  5 too many times has this game gone from a sure win to an absolute loss giving up at 20 mins is good if you re running low on time but encouraging your team and playing the game out can lead to a wonderful win  6 play with a friend that keeps you in check someone who can calm you or give you direction the game is more fun with friends anyway  7 lastly kills are awesome and they make you feel good when you get them but you re more likely to win if you complete the objectives always have an objective in mind when your top is getting ganked by 5 people then the other 4 people on your team better be pushing lanes or doing dragon  this should all be common advise by now but thought i d type it out cause it helps remind me of whats important anyway  ,d02fbjl,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455659966.0,savaj,4.0,0.0,14.0,88.0,0.0

96333,96334,i started to play lol after about 2000 games of hots  and jaina was my most played hero in ranked  i hate artanis though   so we re in similar positions  here s what i can tell you   the champions in lol are more complex than the heroes in hots  in general   and there are a lot more of them this means it will take you a lot longer to get to the point where you can counter play effectively you ll probably feel quite lost in your first games due to the sheer amount of gamechampion knowledge that you re still lacking   you might be disappointed in how most matches unfold compared to hots hots has a more modern design  you spend more time of the game doing interesting stuff compared to lol there are 10 different maps  which keeps the game experience diversified and fresh in league of legends you ll find that most matches amount to a laning phase followed by a very drawn out team fight in the mid lane this is not true for higher ranked games  but you wo nt be in high ranked games for a  long  time in other words  you might actually be very disappointed by that aspect of lol  overall flow of the game    related to the above  league of legends  like dota  has a  laning phase  which is usually at least 15 minutes long  and that you spend farming gold from minions  and trying to outplay your lane opponent  s   only  very  very rarely  are these first 15 minutes of the game more interesting than the first 15 minutes of a hots game  hots games only last 20 minutes on average   and you have to do it in every game  regarding your specific question  jaina is a backline damage dealer that depends a lot on good positioning and clever application of your crowd control artanis is your typical tanky melee bruiser  with that in mind  you ll probably enjoy morgana  lux  orianna  leblanc morgana and lux are both good because you can play them solo in the mid lane and as support champions in the bot lane  artanis corresponds to champions like fiora  riven  volibear  malphite  hecarim  shyvana  who are tanky and still capable of dealing damage  unfortunately it s not easy to compare lol and hots in this fashion  because the games are designed quite differently  and so are the heroes  i like to play tanks in hots  because it gives me a lot of control over team fights  but in lol i do nt really care about that  because full blown team fights are more rare  and tanks play differently  so at the end of the day you have to try out all roles and enough champions to find out for yourself  you should also refer to the following sources for information   championgg  the league of legends wiki  youtube and twitch to be honest i find most of the guide websites pretty bad  the average quality of the guides is low there are good ones but you wo nt find them easily while you still need them ,d01u141,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455627816.0,siggboy,55.0,0.0,1.0,84.0,0.0

97581,97582,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,603.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0

103542,103543,so today riot released the  planned venues for worlds 2016   http  wwwlolesportscomen_usarticles2016worldchampionshiphitsnorthamerica   and they ve finally decided to come to chicago the midwest has missed out on major esports events in the past  and i know many people in the chicagoland area who are beyond excited for the quarter finals to be held here in the windy city  but riot booked a venue with less than 4000 seats sure  the  chicago theater   https  enwikipediaorgwikichicago_theatre  is beautiful and iconic  but in a city of millions  in a region starving for a major esports event  limiting yourself to 3500 seats is absolutely ridiculous  i ca nt believe they d limit themselves to such a small venue  when there are many larger venues in the city  and many that are available during october 13th  16th  for example  the  allstate arena   https  enwikipediaorgwikiallstate_arena   in rosemont illinois  just outside of the city of chicago  holds between 16 and 18500 people the arena is also in an easily accessible area  without the major congestion of downtown chicago they have way more parking available  and they re serviced by multiple forms of public transit   and they re available for the quarter finals   http  wwwrosemontcomallstate   just shift over to october 2016  edit  allstate is just one example there are many venues in chicago with far more seats ,466d7w,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455680680.0,IrrelevantGeOff,324.0,0.0,1293.0,11142.0,0.0

105778,105779,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,342.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

122030,122031,i feel like the difference is that niels has to carry for his team to win  in contrast forg1ven can approach a rather macro focused playstyle  because of strong players on all other positions that s why it s hard to compare those two  since they really have to play completely different styles  if i had to decide which one is better atm i d probably give the edge to niels  although i am a huge forg1ven fanboy the sole reason for this is niels mastery of kalista he plays arguably the best western kalista  and kalista is a power pick in this meta whereas forg1ven is a master on caitlyn  lucian and corki but wouldnt even dare to touch kalista imo this will be a huge problem later in playoffs but i still love to watch that guy play  his movements and his spacing  look like a fking script ,d023fcu,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455644044.0,Nintentea,7.0,0.0,1.0,22238.0,0.0

127167,127168,i actually think ahri is getting nerfed the wrong way  charm can not cancel dashes anymore   i mean  i know ahri deserves some nerfs  but i do nt think this is a good way to nerf her  actually placing a charm while a dash is part of the potential of outplay  plus  laning against leblanc as ahri is actually already rough  it will totally destroy this lane  i actually think ahri should be more rewarded when hitting her skillshots correctly  her base damage should maybe be nerfed and the old bonus damage applied on charmed target should come back  giving more cd but reseting the cd or half cd if the target gets killed   ahri is a burst mage  or even an assassin  it s normal that she can one burst anyone  but it should happen while playing it correctly  not by spamming w r ignite  i mean  using the charm to cancel a dash is an important part of the gameplay  it punishes other s mistakes and gives counterplay  welp  i made this post most likely to know other s opinion and to share mine i know most of people are a lot salty about ahri  but i think it s understandable that this is not a good way to nerf her  at least  that s what i thought  got ta tag uvertigahri to know your opinion since you re a otp ahri ,464gac,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455655034.0,RivenBadChampKappa,1191.0,0.0,1274.0,5408.0,0.0
127168,127169,yeah  i 100  agree  it provides much more room for outplay playing against an ahri i ve never been upset that i died because i got hit by a charm  because that s my error  i have however many times nearly thrown my keyboard when an ahri 1000 s me without hitting a single skillshot i think the interrupt is one thing that really differentiates her from other mids  and provides a more favorable matchup against the cancer that is panth mid right now his w is so easy to interrupt  but almost no mids have any means of doing so ,d02ci4c,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455656219.0,JustHumpedPanda,487.0,0.0,1.0,913.0,0.0

127173,127174,this was ahri s tool against fizzleblanccorki removing it will most likely not harm ahri a lot but it will make these champions stronger in the match up  i still ca nt think of a reason why you would nt revert her q movespeed change to the original and give charm the amplification back  but hey  it s not like it was the most obvious way of balancing ahri after the change that made her broken and began the spiral of nerfs rito too stubborn ,d02hhia,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455663031.0,Quaggsire,12.0,0.0,92.0,42644.0,0.0

127188,127189,i agree that charm should still stop dashes however  i take issue with some of the other things you said  first  unless she s fed  ahri is not a burst mage her damage when compared with champions like leblanc is a joke she s really a rare breed of kiting mage in fact  you could argue that she s the only true kiting mage in the game possible exceptions are tf  karma  and ori as such  taking away kiting potential serves only to weaken her identity and seems utterly backwards  as you said  second  the change to ahri s charm that made it increase damage is what made me stop playing her i ca nt speak for everyone  but in my opinion this turned an exciting and engaging champion into a boring  binary  and just generally unfun one with that change in place  you have to open any engagement with a charm you do nt have to pick your moments at all did you hit your charm  if yes  go in it made ahri a burst mage  because if you could nt kill your target during that short damage boost period  you did nothing  to me  toning down the damage on charm a little would be a healthy change  edit  people are misunderstanding i know charm no longer gives bonus damage i do nt want it to come back because i think it ruined ahri ,d02is36,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455664979.0,Shadowlink839,9.0,0.0,4.0,28.0,0.0

128279,128280,svenskeren is nt going to work out it s just interesting to think about how strong this team would ve been if they had a cerebral jungle player like reignover instead they impulsively took svenskeren in a bidding war and shot themselves in the foot  you can tell the philosophy in creating this team was off from the beginning instead of putting together a well rounded squad  regi thought stacking the roster with brawns and no brains was the solution to their issues particularly in the vanilla version with kasing  look at imt you re balancing the brawns with intelligent good macro players like reignover and adrian skt last season was the same deal wolf was nt a laning monster  but easily one of the most intelligent supports in recent history with high impact roams  decisive engages  and vision control bengi is nt going to dumpster you with rengar  but he will make ganking any of his lanes impossible and seize every good opportunity to control the map then you have the same scenario of star players in topmidadc  fnatic last season  star players in top mid and adc  intelligent macro players in support and jungle  this just seems like the winning formula for super teams following in this logic yellowstar is a perfect match assuming they actually start respecting his input and playing to his strengths all you need is a really intelligent jungle player who can control the map and together with yellowstar put a brain behind the muscle of the tsm machine  i do nt think tsm is a lost cause they do need to be aggressively pursuing a better jungler that fits the team  as well as a coach who they can respect who will shape out an actual identity for these guys ,d0291rb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455651657.0,joesphaa,0.0,0.0,1.0,1534.0,0.0

129082,129083,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given ,d022z9v,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455643435.0,WatashiWaInoriDesu,33.0,0.0,1.0,1807.0,0.0
129103,129104,svenskeren is nt going to work out it s just interesting to think about how strong this team would ve been if they had a cerebral jungle player like reignover instead they impulsively took svenskeren in a bidding war and shot themselves in the foot  you can tell the philosophy in creating this team was off from the beginning instead of putting together a well rounded squad  regi thought stacking the roster with brawns and no brains was the solution to their issues particularly in the vanilla version with kasing  look at imt you re balancing the brawns with intelligent good macro players like reignover and adrian skt last season was the same deal wolf was nt a laning monster  but easily one of the most intelligent supports in recent history with high impact roams  decisive engages  and vision control bengi is nt going to dumpster you with rengar  but he will make ganking any of his lanes impossible and seize every good opportunity to control the map then you have the same scenario of star players in topmidadc  fnatic last season  star players in top mid and adc  intelligent macro players in support and jungle  this just seems like the winning formula for super teams following in this logic yellowstar is a perfect match assuming they actually start respecting his input and playing to his strengths all you need is a really intelligent jungle player who can control the map and together with yellowstar put a brain behind the muscle of the tsm machine  i do nt think tsm is a lost cause they do need to be aggressively pursuing a better jungler that fits the team  as well as a coach who they can respect who will shape out an actual identity for these guys ,d0291rb,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455651657.0,joesphaa,2.0,0.0,1.0,1534.0,0.0

130174,130175,biggest change for me when i played hots after playing lol for years was not buying items i couldnt get over it idk why but it made the game feel simple and characters were only allowed one role or so it felt when i played at release have nt gone back they have recommended builds but i would also recommend looking them up for the current season all of the 450 champs are pretty decent especially poppy she was recently reworked so i d recommend getting them first do not buy runes until you re sumoner level 20 and can buy tier 3 runes otherwise you re wasting ip  influence points you gain from games   another thing is lanes i dont recall lanes being much of a thing in hots  but the na meta rn is a solo top lane which is generally a tankybruiser charecter with a jungle also will most likely be tankybruiser but they do have assassin jungles as well  then you got solo mid which is generally a ranged ap champ finally on bottom you got 2 champs 1  adc  attack damage carry  theyre job is to get fed and stack a bunch of ad  attack speed and crit chance the other on bottom is the support  generally a champ with good crowd control or healing abilities  or both  sorry for wall of text i can just think of a lot of little tips for someone starting ,d01r3dg,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455617183.0,daogrande,9.0,0.0,309.0,1071.0,0.0

132223,132224,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air   https  zippygfycatcomringedgiftedlangurwebm  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox     http  iimgurcomw3ei6k4jpg  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox     http  iimgurcomcfoalrlpng    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view   https  fatgfycatcomunequaledunkemptgossamerwingedbutterflywebm    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip ,462s6r,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455634789.0,Ichiago,604.0,0.0,52.0,11721.0,0.0

132231,132232,this is actually a little inaccurate what you are showing as character hitboxes are actually their  clickboxes   they are still a good indicator of the actual hitbox  but they normally have a radius that is 2030 units larger than the actual hitbox  because of this  it makes it appear that the center of a projectile must hit the edge of the clickbox when in actuality the projectile s hitbox  which is almost always a line  only has to hit the hitbox on the edges this along with camera perspective and lag causes the  buggy  hitboxes in the game ,d01zvf8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455638999.0,FrankTheBoxMonster,7.0,0.0,2.0,2719.0,0.0

135920,135921,ok  so since i m a huge pokemon nerd  i feel like reviewing this and explaining changes i d make and why soooohere we go  aatrox  darkflying  yep  ahri  psychicfire  sound s right  akali  dark  dark works for the ninja thing  but her balance motif lends itself to the fighting type i think i d go darkfighting  pure fighting  or even psychicfighting  alistar  fighting  yeah  either this or normalfighting works  amumu  groundghost  works fine  though waterghost would be funny  not serious  p   anivia  iceflying  i mean  she s basically articuno anyway  annie  fire  fire or firedark  ashe  ice  do nt see anything wrong with this  azir  flyingground  cause he s a sandbird  geddit  bard  fairy  the new fairy typing fits bard perfectly  blitzcrank  steelelectric  most definitely  brand  fire  yep  braum  iceground  sure  caitlyn  steel  works for me steelnormal would be an interesting typing though haha  cassiopeia  poison  snakelady i guess you could go poisonrock too because reasons  but yeah  pure poison is perfectly fine  chogath  darkground  yeah  sure  corki  steelfire  i would personally go fireflying or steelflying  but steelfire works i suppose  darius  steelfighting  warrior plus armor equals steelfighting i guess  could have dark replace either if you wanted  diana  darkfairy  aside from being an awesome typing  it works pretty well for diana  dr mundo  normalpoison  love it  draven  normal  do nt let draven hear you call him normal though could also be a fighting type  ekko  normal  ekko is an interesting one his time shenanigans makes me want to say psychic  but he does nt actually have powers i think normal was a good call steel could have worked as well i think  elise  darkbug  yeah  evelynn  dark  yep  ezreal  psychic  hmmm i suppose psychic is good here  fiddlesticks  flying  i m a little confused by this one i get crows  but fiddlesticks is clearly a ghost type  p fiora  fighting  yep  fizz  water  of course  galio  flyingrock  yeah  gargoyles  gangplank  firewater  haha  i actually like that  garen  steelfighting  i think garen fits this type best out of the other champs you gave this type  gnar  normal  one badass normal can gnar s megaevolution be normaldragon  c  gragas  fightingpoison  works for me  graves  fire  may as well be  hecarim  ghost  yep  heimerdinger  steelelectric  yeah pure steel is fine too the magnemite line is starting to feel encroached upon haha  illaoi  fightingwater  this is fine  irelia  steelfighting  again  could just go single type fighting if you want otherwise it works  janna  normalflying  sure could also be a good contender for the elusive pure flying type  jarvan iv  fighting  what  no steel type for this guy  i jest  pure fighting is fine  jax  fighting  not sure where else you could go here  jayce  steelelectric  poor magnemite  jhin  darkgrass  eh  if you want to run with the flower motif then fine otherwise pure dark is good too  jinx  steelfire  i dunno about steel honestly i suppose it works  but you could also go pure fire  or even forego steel for normal or dark jinx is a bit of a tough one to type  kalista  ghost  ghost works for most shadow isles champs  and kalista might even make a great ghostfighting if you re not already sick of fighting types on this list haha  karma  psychic  pretty much  karthus  ghost  yeah  kassadin  dark  sure  katarina  steel  steel  dark  or darksteel would all work for kat  kayle  fireflying  yeah  this is fine  kennen  electric  kennen is pikachu confirmed  khazix  bug  works fine for kha  kindred  darkfairy  fits kindred s themes perfectly  kogmaw  poison  yeah  leblanc  psychic  yep  lee sin  fighting   sigh  yes  leona  firesteel  hell yes  lissandra  darkice  personally would just go ice  but dark is fine too  lucian  dark  because he s black  i think lucian strikes me as a special fighting type like lucario hell fightingsteel would work  lulu  fairy  lulu is the definition of a fairy type  lux  psychicfairy  as funny as i find this  it works for lux  haha  malphite  groundrock  because pokemon needs more terrible groundrock types but yeah  malzahar  dark  i would go for the darkpsychic here  maokai  grassghost  yeah  that suits maokai pretty well  master yi  fighting  yeah  miss fortune  fire  probably the best you ll get with mf  mordekaiser  steelghost  beautiful  morgana  darkflying  yeah sure  nami  water  fish  nasus  darkfire  hmmm  there are a few types nasus could be  but darkfire works fine i think  nautilus  darkwater  this or steelwater both make a lot of sense for nautilus  nidalee  grass  hell  i d go for normalgrass if you re bent on the grass type  nocturne  darkdark  you re funny but in all seriousness  darkghost makes a lot of sense for him  nunu  ice  sure  olaf  fightingice  huh i guess that makes sense actually  orianna  steelelectric  i actually think steelpsychic would fit oriana better  pantheon  steelfighting  steel does make sense  but i would still go pure fighting personally maybe its just me  poppy  steelfighting   sigh  i guess  quinn  flying  pure flying for quinn  well that s quite an honor i d go normalflying because i m boring  p rammus  ground  no more really needs to be said here  reksai  darkground  i like it  renekton  ground  sure  works fine  rengar  fighting  can we just make rengar normal so we do nt have so many damn fighting types  haha  or dark  i do nt care  _   riven  fighting  well i guess if you have to  i rumble  steelelectric  uhhhsteelfire instead  ryze  psychic  yeah  i guess that s the best you can do with ryze  sejuani  ice  yerp  shaco  dark  yerp  shen  darkfighting  i guess if ninjas have to be dark  shyvana  firedragon  oh finally  a dragon type  ao shin  please  you must restore balance  _   singed  poison  because he s toxic  right  sion  steelfire  heatran is starting to feel sad  sivir  normal  i suppose  skarner  rockbug  skarner skarner  skarner  sona  psychic  wynaut  soraka  psychicfairy  yus  swain  darkflying  extra yus  syndra  dark  yeah could be psychic too  but dark is fine  tahm kench  darkwater  river demon  yeah  makes sense  talon  steel  yeah  i m fine with this  taric  fairyrock  i should nt laugh  but i will anyway  teemo  grasspoison  nah  should obviously be darkfire lt  sgt  thresh  ghost  yep  tristana  fire  might as well  trundle  fightingice  ehhhh  could just as well be pure ice  tryndamere  fighting  sure  twisted fate  psychic  sure  twitch  poison  yep  udyr  fightingnormal  yeah  i suppose could be pure fighting too  urgot  darksteel  ya know  i ll take your word on this one i m not really sure what i d do with urgot  varus  dark  so edgy  vayne  dark  i do nt know steel maybe  vayne is another tough one  veigar  darkfairy   who are you calling a fairy   velkoz  dark  personally would add psychic or go pure psychic  vi  steelfighting  i mean i guess you have to at this point  viktor  steelelectric  probably the best you can do for victor  vladimir  psychic  not sure about anyone else  but i d think vlad is more of a dark type than a psychic type  volibear  normalelectric  sure iceelectric would be interesting if only because polarbear but normalelectric makes more sense haha  warwick  normal  or dark or normaldark i mean either way  wukong  fightingrock  makes sense for wukong  xerath  psychic  sure  xin zhao  fighting  sure  yasuo  fightingflying  sure  yorick  groundghost  i dig it  zac  poison  once again  sure  zed  darkfighting  see  i like this typing on zed if not on the other ninjas  ziggs  steelfire  personally think steel feels uneccessary i think ziggs is pure fire  zilean  psychic  seeing as there s no timelord type  this is the next best thing  zyra  psychicgrass  this typing works just fine on zyra  whew i ca nt believe i just did that thanks for giving me something fun to do for a while i wonder how many times a pokemon s typing goes back and forth between different

135922,135923,there is only 1 pure flying type in the world of pokemon  if you re trying to make it accurate give fiddlesticks another type like dark or fairy  or even grass since he has a drain  gnar can be switched to ground to be more like cubonemarowak  shaco could also be fairy typing imo and sona maybe normalpsychic or fairypsychic  think gardevoir   khazix is basically scyther so you could add flying to him too,d01859q,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455578296.0,OrigenInori,6.0,0.0,1.0,2628.0,0.0

ground   normalghost  there s nothing particularly ground about amumu  and the only  mummy  pokemon are  all   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikiyamask_  pok  c3  a9mon     mono   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikicofagrigus_  pok  c3  a9mon     ghost   http  bulbapediabulbagardennetwikidusclops_  pok  c3  a9mon    but amumu is less mysterious and ethereal and is definitively more corporeal which makes normal seem like a better subtype  than nothing at all   additionally normalghost gives amumu ridiculous resistances befitting such a tanky champion  anivia  iceflying  flying is purely thematic on her but in lieu of another type  such as psychic  i d say it s still a better fit than monotype ice  annie  fire   dark    regardless of 45 of her abilities being fire tibbers is some dark magic  and she is called the  dark  child  ashe  ice  got ta have some monotyping somewhere although given that she s just as much about shooting people as she is about ice an argument could be made for icefighting  azir    flying   ground  just because he looks like a bird does not make him a bird  and even if it did it would nt make him flying none of his kit is about flying  psychic would be a better secondary type  but i d wager monotype is probably best for our guardian of the sands  bard  fairy  yup blitzcrank  steelelectric  yup brand  fire  yup braum  ice   ground   steel  his ultimate is ice  not ground i d almost go for fairy or psychic for his defensive shields but steel typing and the fact his kit is all about a piece of metal lends intself towards steel  caitlyn  steel  as much as i hate it  steel is by far the best fit  especially because of her traps  cassiopeia  poison  yep chogath  darkground  for other void champs i d lean towards psychic as a subtype  but this fits cho perfectly  corki  steelfire  yup darius  steelfighting  yup diana  darkfairy  yup dr mundo    normal   fightingpoison  mundo smash  draven    normal   fighting  he s got ta be

psychicfairy  fiddlesticks    flying   dark   ghost    i mean he has  dark wind  and he s a possessed scarecrow he could use flying type moves but he sure as heck is nt flying  fiora  fighting   steel    if caitlyn is steel  fiora is definitely steel  fizz  water  yup galio  flyingrock  yup gangplank  fire   water   steel  if for nothing else but his ultimate  garen  steelfighting  sword fighter same as fiora  gnar    normal   fighting  cmon he s almost literally a cubone  gragas  fighting   poison   water  as much as i d like to say alcohol is poison he does damage by splashing people with

he is spooking you to death  heimerdinger  steelelectric  that  or just electric with steel moves  illaoi  fighting   water   ghost  as tempting as it is to have tentacles be water  they re not just any tentacles  they re spirit tentacles so i d say ghost  or maybe psychic or dark depending on your interpretation  irelia  steelpsychic  will of the blades and all it s right there in the name

147385,147386,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it  https  youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  3c7a2g9ucs0,4622q8,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455622483.0,DontBlameWill,347.0,0.0,64.0,217.0,0.0

149297,149298,everyone forgot lms again lol top  ziv  arguably the best nonkorean toplaner in the world  ca nt wait to see this guy again at msi if ahq makes it  jungle  karsa  karsa is still such a wildcard as he has both good games and bad games  but his full potential is definitely better than mountain s  mid  chawymaple  hard to say for this because ahq is a better team across the board where as maple can still solo carry if needed westdoor still has the same style despite showing a little better champ pool and i m almost certain if ahq makes it to msi  chawy would be the better choice internationally  adc  an  the best adc in lms imo and definitely a top 10 worldwide  support  swordartalbisolleh  this is the hardest category as all 3 have their own strengths and weaknesses  but by the time playoffs comes around i ll be interested to see who comes out on top  i ll do one for lpl anyways  top  koro1flandre  koro is getting back to form and the meta suits him a lot better nowadays and flandre is still a top carry looper gets a honorary mention but i feel like he really needs mata to shine  jungle  clearloveswift  it s definitely between these 2 jungle beasts for best jungler in lpl cl plays more around his team and is more sacrificial in his playstyle swift is right now one of the best carry junglers in the world however  he requires a lot of resources and peel so it ll be interesting to see qg at iem  mid  rookiedoinb  i ca nt believe i m not including pawn but to me he is honestly just plug and fill and though he s not the best  he plays his role well in edg but on pure skill it ll have to be rookie as the best lpl mid laner mechanically why doinb  because he s actually much better than most people give him credit for and he brings so much versatility and flexibility to qg that i do nt think any other midlaner bar faker would bring he can actually hold his lane and when it comes to teamfights  his power levels increase tremendously  adc  pecodeft  i m not sold on wuxx and think he ll be a liability if he does not reign in his sometimes too aggressive nature every other adc is slumping  just decent  or not having enough playtime eg uzi  support  meikomatamor  the 3 m s meiko when he is on point is a top 5 support in the world  especially on engage champions mata is not quite at s4 levels but his vision game and communication with looper is what is keeping rng at the top of group b for now mor has to do so much peeling for swift and v that he is underrated because he does nt shine as much back in na lcs he died the most but also was vital to lmq s playstyle now on a resurgent qg he has better teammates and his skill level also increased and he s definitely a beast support ,d02lpkv,leagueoflegends,gaming,1455669585.0,krazy2xtreme,10.0,0.0,352.0,5432.0,0.0
