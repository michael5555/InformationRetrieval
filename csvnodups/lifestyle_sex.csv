6,last i was talking to people that did it  chaturbate was the best for couples  income varies greatly based on time on screen  the flow of users  time of day and year  etc generally  unless you do it as a full time job  you re not going to be able to pay the bills doing it you can generate enough to supplement things nicely though low end that i ve heard equals out to three or four bucks an hour high end can equate to thirty plus  if you re doing it for fun that you get paid for  there s nothing to lose  but be aware that once it s on the internet  it s there pretty much forever you can guarantee that eventually someone will capture the stream and spread iti knew a couple that wore masks on cam  sometimes costumes as well  overall  it s a difficult field to turn into regular  reliable income  but it can be great for extra pocket money,d01imzf,sex,lifestyle,1455594971.0,southsamurai,8.0,0.0,20,8749,0.0

12,my  22f  boyfriend  23m  of 7 months got the results of his most recent lab work today and found out that he has hsv1 based on my last testing  done in december of last year  i don  t have it  but i do plan on getting testing again soon despite me telling him that it  s very common and that the symptoms are not always severe  he believes that his life is over as he knows it he feels that he  ll never be able to have a regular relationship  get married  have kids  etc many of the things he wanted to do prior to receiving the diagnosis  i am still interested in being with him  but he  s really worried about transmitting it to me i told him that it  s still possible to engage in activities with the diagnosis and that just because one partner has it  the other one is not guaranteed to get it and maybe this sounds na  ve  but even if i were to get it  in my opinion herpes is basically a skin condition that may or may not flare up that is usually otherwise benign in other words  though i would not like to not get it  it would not be the end of the world if i did also  because it is so common  i feel like even if i don  t get it from him  there  s a fair chance that i could get it in the future  am i being na  ve  is he being overly dramatic  or is it a combination of the two  what should i tell him  also  he plans to get retested and i plan to get tested again this week  edit 1  he was diagnosed via blood test for igg antibodies tl  dr boyfriend recently diagnosed with hsv1  feels life is over,465fqv,sex,lifestyle,1455667737.0,ilikepretezels,0.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

19,i m a pretty ugly guy  there is very little about my face or body that would be considered attractive i know attraction is subjective  but i highly doubt any woman would consider me a 7 or above i imagine the subjectivity of attraction means i range from 25  maybe a 6 if i m particularly witty that day and i m not saying i only want supermodels  but i do want women i m attracted to given that there is nothing physically attractive about me  going for women who have attractive features means i m batting out of my league  it s well understood by almost everyone that attraction is an important part of a relationship  and pretty much the only factor in a hookup or fuck buddy situation nobody wants a relationship without attraction  that s just a friendship but when it comes to ugly people  apparently this does nt apply i m told to lower my standards  and take what i can get i should be grateful for unfulfilling sex with women i m not attracted to if i want a one night stand  it has to be with a woman as ugly as me  which is nt very tempting if i want a relationship  i m supposed to look past the physical and see the inner beauty  even though no woman with options would ever do that for me  i see a lot of unattractive couples  but honestly i think they re with each other because that s all they can get  and they both know it there s no passion  no attraction  no lust it s just that or dying alone you can call me shallow  but how many of you would date someone you were nt attracted to  i ve never felt passion  chemistry or mutual attraction i ve never been desired or lusted after if good looking women are nt attracted to me  why would an unattractive woman fancy me  the answer is they would nt  they d be settling for me just like i d be settling for them  and the relationship would be a sexless  passionless sham  is there any hope for people like me  am i making sense  or is this all just depressive bullshit  if so  why  tldri feel like i ll never have a good sexual relationship because the women i want are nt attracted to me  and the women i could get would just be settling for me  and i d be settling for them ,464q93,sex,lifestyle,1455658500.0,EverytingsShinyCaptn,2.0,0.0,1,249,0.0

21,a thread here got me thinking about something i just realized i ve never thought to ask before when my wife and i have piv sex  we do the usual inoutinout about a quarter of the time  and the other 34 we grind against each other s pelvises  for her the grinding simulates her clit and deepspot  for me it s twofold it feels like she s either milking me or gnashing the tip of my penis hard against the end of her vagina now  that second sensation is only possible because my cock is slightly longer than her pussy is deep there s about a quarter of an inch of shaft that either does nt go in  or if it does  it s because my penis is slightly bent inside her if she was half an inch deeper  this sensation would be completely gone  i know because i ve had exes that were deeper  now  on to my question when you  or your partner  grinds is there a sense of  completeness   for lack of better terms  if the penis is slightly larger than what the vagina can fully engulf  or conversely  is there a sense of lacking if the opposite were the case ,464l4y,sex,lifestyle,1455656698.0,WayneCider,1.0,0.0,1,553,0.0

27,one way to start is with massage my gf really likes being touched  both in a relaxing and in a  get in the mood  kind of way it s a nice  slow  affectionate way to get her naked and put my hands all over her then eventually i m kissing my way down her spine and she s wiggling her hips toward the edge of the bed and things heat up from there  one way to finish is with a leisurely  round 2   after a nice hard fuck i ll need a minute  or two  to catch my breath  kiss and cuddle and while i m not always physically capable of repeating an  a  game of vigorous sexual athleticism  sometimes it s nice to just roll over into the spooning position and reenter my partner it s not about chasing another orgasm  well  not to begin with anyway   it s just about the wonderful feeling of holding her tightly as our hips rock together  joining our bodies as deeply as possible while i kiss her neck and tell her how wild she drives me  i mean it  is  sex  and it usually leads to more sex and more orgasms but it does nt have to  and it s not the sort of thing you need to warm up with stretches for ,d02jt0i,sex,lifestyle,1455666633.0,greedymage,11.0,0.0,1,86,0.0
28,me and my girl kind of have a similar issue she s very into just getting fucked  the more control i take and the more i basically use her sexually the better for her most of the time she likes it rough and manhandley  sometimes though we like to get more lovey and passionate it does nt happen often but when it does its always spur of the moment the other day we were visiting my parents and we were getting a little freaky at night time started having fairly hot sex but it was getting a bit loud cuz of body contact and bed and we heard the bathroom door down the hall close and she hopped off immediately kind of panicked and we got under the covers but we were both still turned on and she reached back and guided me in  so we start having sex spooning and i do nt know what it was but man did that heat up  we were grinding into each other and grabbing each other like we ve never done before she could nt keep in her moans and pulled my hand up to cover her mouth we were biting and clawing at each other it was so hot we were moving together so well omg best sex in a loooong time  anyway just let it happen but just do positions that enhance intimacy spooning works well for us ,d02n9m2,sex,lifestyle,1455671993.0,a_friendly,4.0,0.0,31,1978,0.0
29,so i know this kinda fits into the  orgasm troubles  bit in the faq but it s different hear me out  i m in my early 20s  have been masturbating since before i started kindergarden  not that i knew what it was  and apparently doing it wrong or so i m led to believe at the moment  there s a very specific position for me to be in  a very specific amount of pressure to apply to a very specific area and a very specific motion i also like visualising myself in situations that i could nt be in in real life now  do nt get me wrong  this is quite useful because i can get myself off from no arousal in about 2 minutes by myself  the problem is  i have a partner now i have no insecurities  except for fear that i will take too long  or spectatoring issues with him there s plenty of foreplay and we re pretty open so i do tell him what i like etc and he puts a great deal of effort and time into helping me but in the end i always have to revert to my own way  which is also quite  closed  to his further participation due to the position  and by then i feel horrible about how i could nt orgasm   and also feel bad about the visualisation because it feels like i want to cheat on him if that makes sense   so it takes a while for me too i can tell he feels awful about this  i tried masturbating in other ways but when i m not paying attention i find that i always revert to my own movement so that did nt work i also tried not masturbating for a long time before one of our sessions and that did nt help either  what do    tldr  girl has been masturbating the same way for the longest time  nothing else gets her off thus having issues with boyfriend  needs help fixing them  ,463zmb,sex,lifestyle,1455649373.0,throw_away_089,10.0,0.0,1,7,0.0

44,my couple of initial thoughts on troubleshooting this be to try it on top of underwear  as maybe it s a little too specific or intense or that the vibrator is more on the  buzzy  side and a more  rumbly  one could feel a better and just in case  make sure she s aroused  as lots of unaroused clits do nt like to be messed with ,d02cgxq,sex,lifestyle,1455656175.0,SexEdSteve,2.0,0.0,1824,3874,0.0

47,sounds like you re not using it right if she s not really aroused or the vibration is too pinpointed on one spot a lot of times i get that tickled feeling too you need to let her use the vibrator on her own to figure out exactly what she likes  probably in private  without you  and then she can show you for me its a combo of making little circle motions around my clit area with my legs kinda spaced apart pressing down on one spot or just shoving it down her pants is nt going to do much a lot of times if you re not doing it right it either tickles like crazy or if its directly on the clit it can be somewhat painful so just be careful if you re doing it to her let her completely figure it out and then show you my bf puts me on my stomach  ass up  and sits in between my legs and plays with it like that and it drives me to orgasm almost every single time figure out what she likes and do nt be afraid to try every single position  sometimes that detail is all it takes ,d02v7lz,sex,lifestyle,1455684960.0,sctaco,1.0,0.0,11467,88,0.0

56,not being circumcised is the norm in a hell of a lot of places  and it s the natural state of a penis sex is nt any more difficult with a foreskin  in fact it s probably easier since there is less of a necessity for lube  your foreskin will move just like it does when you masturbate it slides up and down practice putting a condom on a few times and masturbating before you are planning to have sex so you can figure out how to do it properly and comfortably  the inside of a vagina is wet and soft  unlike your hand the sensitivity you feel is a good thing  though the sensations of sex can be a little weird the first time since you think a lot about what you re meant to be doing and feeling try to relax  you have nothing to worry about  and remember that everyone was inexperienced at some point but you will work it out with time and practice  the faq is a great thing to read  so i would recommend you take a look happy sexhaving ,d023g7k,sex,lifestyle,1455644075.0,such_a_sin,4.0,0.0,1,14711,0.0

58,it works the same way for circumcised and uncircumcised the foreskin naturally rolls back as you thrust in and exposes the head for all that nice vagina kissing  when wearing a condom  you have your hard cock as normal  pinch the top of the condom  place it on the top of your penis and roll down you should have a good bit of excess condom at the top to catch cum and what not as you move in and out with the condom on  your foreskin will naturally move a bit  but it all works the same 8090  of the work is not circumcised  so it is pretty normal  ,d0280dr,sex,lifestyle,1455650265.0,Chubguyv1980,2.0,0.0,1,72,0.0

96,if you re feeling terrified and full of dread  do not go along with it stop where you are continue to talk about it continue to fantasize about it or role play with it  but do not actually do anything until you can think about it  without  being terrifiedfull of dread that way lies trouble  and it is  okay  if you are  never  comfortable with actually having a threesome  and note that there s a difference between being scarednervousanxious  kind of like the feeling you get before going on a roller coaster or going into an interview  and feeling like doom and gloom is going to descend on you if you do something  the thing with a threesome is  if everybody s going to play with everyone else  eg it s a triangle  not a v   then it s a positive if everyone  wants  everyone else  it s about everyone sexually enjoying everyone else if that s not something you can see yourself wanting or being okay with  then this may not be for you at the very least  it may not be something to jump into head first  i say that  because your thoughtsfeelingsreactions can shift over time  if you do  eventually  decide to engage in a threesome  understand that there s always the possibility that your boyfriend will pay more attention to the third party  even if it s not on purpose this does nt mean he does nt love and want you  but newnessit s exciting  you might even find yourself paying more attention to your guest than your boyfriend  in any kind of group encounter  you have to be willing and able to speak up and say  hey  can i get a little attention here   or  you need to have a nonverbal signal with your partner that tells him  i m feeling a little left out  or  slow down  you can also negotiate some things being  off the menu  for your first time out you say you changed your boundary from him not having piv sex with the third to him not coming inside her is that something you want  or were you just trying to make him happy  if it s the latter  you may need to revisit that boundary  bottom line  if you re not comfortable with something  do nt do it and do nt negotiate it if you decide you want to engage in a threesome at some point  find a middle ground with your boyfriend talk your boundaries death make a rule that if either one of you wants to quit  at any time  that you quit  though please be respectful to your third partner should you quit in the middle of things  and do nt act on anything if you feel that dread ,d010x4k,sex,lifestyle,1455567588.0,sangetencre,25.0,0.0,1,1337,0.0

98,before doing anything outside your comfort zone  it s always a good idea to communicate really really clearly about expectations talk about it  and then talk about it some more it does nt have to be tedious  it can be sexy fantasizing together  a threesome especially has great potential for awkwardness because it s an odd number third wheel  is a phrase for a reason  something that might help to consider  what do you want the dynamic of the threesome to feel like  possibilities   you and the bf focus on the other girl  sort of team up to pleasure her  bf and the other girl focus on you  you and the other girl focus on bf maybe you guys rotate between all these dynamics  sex  really  any interaction between people  always has a dyadic component that is  when it comes down to it  there is always an interaction happening between two people in a twosome  it s always the same two in a threesome  it switches around  and you ll have multiple twosomes happening at the same time  in sex particularly  one partner is always doing something to the other partner ie at the barest level  person a touches person b in a certain way and produces certain sensations it feels twoway if person b then reciprocates  or does something to person a at the same time in a twosome  both partners can always be simultaneously doing something to each other  it s a little harder to focus on two people simultaneously  so in a threesome  the reciprocity is not as straightforward  this might be getting way too abstract anyway  go back to the possibilities and think about which one you would be most comfortable with see if that helps ,d01fl9w,sex,lifestyle,1455590125.0,FierceCrayon,3.0,0.0,1,21,0.0

157,ignoring that objectively unattractive is an oxymoron  and assuming you just mean what most peoples subjective tastes are  the only meaningful question is  is it possible for  me  to have a satisfying sex life   then it depends on what you mean by possiblethe realm of human possibilities is vast and near infinite there are people who like to fuck corpses  people who like to fuck animals if those things are possible  then someone wanting to fuck an averagely unattractive guy is obviously fully possible  if by  possible  you mean  practical and realistic to expect   then that entirely depends on how ugly you are  how high your standards are  and how many chances you take  if you take maybe a handful of chances a year  and have a completely unremarkable life on top  then the odds are against you if you rely on your looks to attract people women who find you attractive are nt just going to drop into your life and sweep you off your feet  if you have a tendency to have automatic negative thoughts  then its important to make a distinction between actually being shit out of luck and actually not bothering to change things you have the power to change  if you re constantly meeting new people  getting involved in interesting and exciting things  improving yourself and the way you interact with people  and you ve not had the faintest whiff of interest from a girl then perhaps you re one of the extremely unfortunate minority who are nt going to have a mutually enjoyable sex life  if however you re spending most of your spare time in a pit of distraction and selfobsession  have an unfulfilling workhome life  and generally have one week look like any other week in your life with no change from year to year then you might consider that its not some inherent defect in yourself that s to blame  but an inevitable result of a habit of poor life choices  the fact you re dedicating time enough worrying about your appearance to ask the question probably means you re letting automatic negative thoughts dictate a lot of your behavior  and probably are nt dedicating sufficient energies to positive  fulfilling and enhancing life experiences  regardless of whether you re the ugliest guy in the world or not you can still have a happy  fulfilling life and have good relationships with other people  but this possibility gets more remote the more selfdestructive and selfpitying your thoughts are ,d02gic2,sex,lifestyle,1455661631.0,suninabox,1.0,0.0,147,66155,0.0
158,hello  have not ever posted to this subreddit but the more time goes on the more this issue is bothering me my boyfriend and i have a great relationship and i am very very sexually attracted to him he says he feels the same for me and sometimes i believe him because he is generally the one who initiates and sometimes even gets hard from brushing up against me when we are out places he is always telling me i am beautiful and he loves me but there is one big issue that leads me to believe he is nt sexually attracted to me the way i am to him  btw forgot to add this but we have been together 1 year 3 months we live together and i am 25 yr old and he is 32  we have sex often upwards of 5 times a week and the only way he can finish is by masturbating at the end on my face on or my chest while i dirty talk to him or moan when we do this he cums within a minute he says he is always close but just ca nt finish unless he does it he has cum inside of me quite a few times but he goes through spells where he will cum in me maybe 56times a month then go 3 months without cumming in me at all and when he has cum inside me the only way he can do that is from behind and once from the side and trying to get him to cum orally or with my hands is impossible it makes me feel utterly pathetic he says its something wrong with him not me but to me that just cant be right all my other boyfriends or men that i ve been with cum nearly instantly the first 15 times we have sex and after that they usually came within 10 minutes i just dont understand why i cant do that with the man i love  he can please me repeatedly without my help and i cant do anything to please him it eats away at me and his answer to it is that hes cum with me more than any other girl hes been with and hes never been able to cum from oral my boyfriend has had threesomes and orgies and been with hundreds of women while he was in the military this is just hard for me to believe that he ca nt cum  there has to be something wrong with me i have researched handjob and oral videos on how to do it better and he reacts to my new techniques well but i know him and he never even gets close from anything i do to him he insists it feels good and that i should nt worry so much about him going but he gets irritated if he ca nt make me cum  its a frustrating situation because i cant talk with him too much about it or it causes him even more performance anxiety so  i know this was alot of ranting but is this because of me not being sexually attractive enough to him or something else ,464nvd,sex,lifestyle,1455657656.0,latenightreads,1.0,0.0,3,222,0.0

176,hi reddit world  i ve been dating my current gf for nearly 35 years we re both in college and graduating this year and most likely will end up being in ld next year but that is tbd  anyways  as the title states  i have a much higher sex drive than she does i masturbate 12 times a day and she almost never  does nt like the idea of self pleasure   our relationship is great and this is someone who i could see myself with in the long run but the only problem is the sex whenever i initiate  which i try to every other day  every day is too much for her  we end up having very vanilla sex or no sex at all whenever she initiates  maybe once a week  we have great sex i ve tried speaking to her about this  but i m always accused of prioritizing sex over the other intimacies of a relationship this is my longest relationship yet  and i would hate to let it go i do nt want to let it go because we have been through so much together and i can continue to see myself with her but this sex issue is bothering me every day i ve contemplated breaking up way too much over the past week because of this issue sex is important to me in a relationship and from what she s told me before  sex is not a necessity for her in a relationship  reading other posts on this thread  i see most responses suggest breaking up due to incompatibility  etc however i really do love her and breaking up is not something i want to do i want to bring this up with her again  but i m afraid i m just going to be told that i m too horny or want sex too often and do nt prioritize the other parts of the relationship  suggestions ,463mjk,sex,lifestyle,1455644969.0,420blazeIt77,43.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

348,fetish might not be the right word  i was nt sure what else to use anyway  i m male and have mainly identified as heterosexual  but ever since i was little i liked and was aroused by wearing women s clothing this itself is pretty common among people  but over the years i ve also become less and less interested in having sex as a man i ve never had sex  and my fantasies have almost always involved me changed into a woman  or being seen as one it s difficult for me to keep myself aroused if i imagine myself as a man having relations with a woman  or with a man either  however  the thought of being a woman  even in non sexual situations  is arousing to me even picturing myself talking to people and having them see me as a woman is a turn on this whole thing kind of bothers me i m just wondering if anyone else out there is similar and could share some experiences regarding this i do nt think i m the only person out there with a similar story  i m just sort of frustrated with this aspect of myself  also  i obviously dress as a woman a fair bit  which is nt much of a turn on in itself but  there are times when i see myself as a woman when i check myself out in the mirror  and it makes me feel pretty happyemotional  on top of some of those feelings of arousal that come from perceiving myself as a woman this is part of the frustration for me i m just feeling pretty confused about my identity and sexuality  and hope someone can relate and offer some advice or anything at times i almost wonder if i could be transgender  but the fact that i get aroused and everything just makes it feel like i m really just someone who is a little perverted ,46574s,sex,lifestyle,1455664346.0,skipchaddle,0.0,0.0,1,3,0.0

354,i m a male 23 year old virgin  but for some reason i almost never have any sex dreams and the few i have had are always terrible mainly because while sex is present in the dream it s never me having sex  because even in my dreams i m still rejected by the ladies  and the few dreams i have had where i m close to having sex nothing materializes as the dream changes into a nightmare before anything  amp  nbsp  anyway i ve become interested in lucid dreaming  thought it would be cool to be able to have sex in my dreams since it s not like it s going to happen in reallife  so after trying a few techniques for awhile i got some success last night was a bit different i actually got to have a sex dream though it was nt what i wanted so i was wondering why do i have such dreams  what could my dream i had last night mean  anyway it goes like this  amp  nbsp  so the dream starts off as an alien abduction  a light comes through my window and somehow beams me onto an alien ship where i immediately notice i m in some sort of surgical room with a bright light shining on my face  lying on a table with these stereotypical short  grey  like aliens standing over me wearing blue jumpsuits and equipped with various surgical tools  at first i m about to panic in fear  but then i decide to calmly assess the situation that s when i realize i m dreaming as i tell my self this ca nt be real as i notice a few absurdities in the dream  i get up ignoring the aliens and just yell out  sweet  i m being abducted by aliens in my dream   i m super excited at this point because since it s my dream i can rewrite reality so i choose to float around exploring the ship amazed at the incredible architecture i find i come up with a plan involving me spending my dream time exploring the galaxy in a cool starship filled with sexy alien girl harem  i know i m a nerd   unfortunately the moment i try to create the girls i wake up  amp  nbsp  after waking i realize i ve only slept for a few hours so i have plenty of time to go back to bed before work so i go back to sleep to continue my dream and hopefully have sex  amp  nbsp  strangely this time in the dream i notice i m naked and i ca nt see at all as i feel hands rubbing all over my body and a sensation of being carried  i realize i m dreaming so i m not worried but i wish i had some light to see what s going on  suddenly i notice lit torches appear around me providing some light and i see that i m in some sort of underground crypt and to my horror surrounded by rotting corpses and the creatures touching and carrying me are zombiesghouls  and skeletons  and i ca nt break free from their grasp  worse yet standing in front of me is a  female   http  oi64tinypiccom2dumrs6jpg   lich   http  wwwsanthariacompicturesfaugarfaugar_picslich1jpg  with glowing white eyes wearing tattered royal robes and a golden crown  amp  nbsp  i try to change the dream  like changing the scenery  changing the lich to a beautiful woman  removing the zombies  etc but nothing works the lich is too powerful and i find myself completely unable to change the dream the lich begins caressing me  licking me  and telling me how i want her and i m just in a state of shock  horror  and strangely some arousal  she also attempts to do some sort of sexy dance and tries to twerk which looks really strange considering she looks like a walking anorexic corpse  after her little dance she sings a few lyrics from   post to be    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  apxvscfoynu   which actually does nt sound half bad  ending with her going up to my ear whispering  if you want me to expose the freak  you got ta eat the booty like groceries  and i m like  wtf    she just ignores me pulls off her dress and tries to sit her undead ass on my face luckily i wake up  amp  nbsp  i try to clear my head and go back to bed hoping i get to have a sexy dream this time  after going back to sleep i try to imagine myself with a beautiful woman  but instead i m back with the lich trapped again this time she asks me why i m rejecting her and then she tells me she thinks i m gay and then with a wave of her hands summons a massive undead minotaur into the room and tells me something along the lines of the minotaur can  keep me company  as it slowly marches towards me as tentacles begin ripping out of it s rotting body i try to tell her i m not gay and definitely not interested in be ripped apart by some giant minotaur but she ignores me  not wanting to have some gay rape dream  i bail  immediately waking up at this point i m pretty annoyed and i just want to sleep so i can go to work in the morning so i go back to bed hoping just to have some peaceful rest  amp  nbsp  strangely i m back with the lich again  i create a giant explosion of light to incinerate her and her undead slaves while many of the undead disintegrate she remains completely unfazed  does nt react in any noticeable way  by this as innumerable undead surround me and then wrestle me to the ground  she disintegrates my clothing and summons her undead minotaur as her minions try to force me to  assume the position  not wanting this dream to get really really gay and painful i give up and lie to her telling her she is incredibly beautiful and that i ve always desired her  happy with this she tells her minions to stand down and we embrace and havesex which actually felt pretty good just dryand coldyeahwoke up feeling pretty dirty after that  nasty stuff  amp  nbsp    tl  dr    i have a lucid dream which gets hijacked by some undead woman who forces me to have sex with her ,462zju,sex,lifestyle,1455637501.0,VampireReaper,1.0,0.0,1,88,0.0

402,we discovered this not long ago and we ve been constantly doing it ever since sometimes i get worried because it s almost like she s high or drunk when i do it really dizzy and sleepy  ca nt speak or think clearly is there any problem with that or is it normal  can she get any sort of brain damage from having little oxigen for several seconds  i never put pressure on her windpipe  i just apply some on the sides where her arteries are  enough to slow the bloodflow i try not to hold it for more than 6 seconds  and she s never passed out from doing it  though it looks like she s close every time so yeah  i just wanted to know if it is safe to continue doing this  especially since we re rather young and if anything were to happen we d both get into a lot of trouble  but it is something we both enjoy very much ,45w7bl,sex,lifestyle,1455538432.0,maneaserban,451.0,0.0,283,791,0.0
403,personally  i love choking a partner  but i never try to actually cut off breathing or blood flow for me  it s more about the dominance of having her by the throat and controlling her that way i do nt squeeze hard enough to cut off blood flow  even temporarily  though  a good way to get a really dominant effect without actually squeezing that tightly is to slide your hand upwards slightly as you squeeze there s a little bit of slip where the skin can slide relative to the underlying tissue  so you start with the top of your hand maybe a half inch to an inch below her neckline then as you squeeze you slide upwards so your hand is nestled into the neckline crease psychologically  it feels like you are tightening your grip  and it really puts her into your power  but you do nt actually have to squeeze tight enough to interrupt blood flow ,d00r4v0,sex,lifestyle,1455553318.0,Mr_Spaz,71.0,0.0,2836,37262,0.0

407,what i have found to be safe and effective is to place the palm of my hand on the upper sternum with my fingers on the neck i press lightly on the sternum  not on the neck  in order to constrict breathing without putting pressure on anything delicate the fingers lightly on the neck still give the person the impression of being choked without the actual choking bonus  if the person bruises easily  marks on the sternum are easier to cover up than marks on the neck ,d00qv8b,sex,lifestyle,1455552901.0,dagnart,1.0,0.0,266,77221,0.0

463,well first the rule of sexual adventures  if you do nt feel comfortable with it  you should wait do nt force yourself you sound like you are pretty young  you still have plenty of time to get comfortable in your relationship and if you never try it  so what  it s not the end of the world  threesomes  like every other sexual activity  require a lot of communication  both before hand and during the act before hand  make sure to set rules and boundaries you are comfortable with come up with a signal in case you are not comfortable and want to change something to the setup during the act another signal if you want to stop everything  honestly  finding the right partner  especially a single woman  will be hard so brace yourself and prepare to be patient do not accept anything that is just  mostly to satisfy his fantasy  if you are not 100  on board talk to the person you have in mind too  as her opinion will also play a role  some people would not go for a threesome where there is no penetration  for example  or in the contrary she might not be comfortable with piv at all and only want feminine contact it all depends   do nt stress too much for now  give yourself time  and you will be fine  ,d00s82w,sex,lifestyle,1455555004.0,LV1016,72.0,0.0,2094,2297,0.0

555,hey everyone  i m new to this sub so if this does nt belong here  please forgive me  so my boyfriend and i have been in a primarily long distance relationship for a little over a year  as he s studying abroad we skype all the time when we can  i study at home  online  and our chemistry is great  we re pretty open when it comes to sex  which is amazing  and we ve talked about trying anal but whenever we try it hurts a lot and i ve encountered spots of blood later on in the day we ve tried inserting a finger in my ass  which went well  but upon removal my anus  froze up  and would nt budge when he tried to put his penis in we ve been using lube so it was nt dry sex  my problem is that  he s coming home in a week or so  and i really want to do this with him he says he has no problems with us not doing it  and i believe him  but i know that if we do it ll be pleasantly surprising for him  is there anything iwe can do to make this happen  so i need to prep at home by myself  how do i do this  advice would really be appreciated  tl  dr  in a ldr  boyfriend comes home in a week  need advice on how to make anal sex happen without it hurting or bleeding    edit    i probably should add that i ve had anal bleeding before  though it s only a tiny spot of blood  even when making a bowel movement this kind of makes me scared as well ,45z3mb,sex,lifestyle,1455574628.0,stopthenadness,60.0,0.0,5,74,0.0
556,the bleeding is likely from a hemorrhoid  if you re getting them from bowel movements  this is probably the culprit maybe go see a doctor to verify  one thing to consider on insertion  do nt clamp down instead  try pushing out  as if you are having a bowel movement this relaxes the anal ring and makes penetration  far  easier ,d016j6r,sex,lifestyle,1455575804.0,alittlebirdy1,11.0,0.0,1,12407,0.0
557,start with a toy that you re comfortable with and work your way up to wider and wider toys each time relax   do nt clench use lots and lots of lube this ca nt be stressed enough  leave the toys in for some time  maybe move them around to let your muscles feel them take them out after a few minutes and apply more lube it can get dry and that is not fun do nt over do it in one sitting if you start feeling sore  stop and continue the next day giving your muscles a chance to relax you ll find that you can start off almost where you left off if you leave it off for a few weeks or more  you re going to have to repeat the process again  if you use a butt plug  do nt leave it in for too long  even though it may feel amazing    and use a lot of lube butt plugs tend to dry up a lot since there s not much in and out movement also  the length does nt matter  the width does butt plugs flare up and if you ca nt take that width comfortably it s going to hurt a lot what s worse  is that since the neck is small you re going to get used to that feeling  and when you try to pull it out after a while  it will hurt like a mofo this will get worse the longer you leave it in  finally get a toy that matches your bf in length and width as close as possible  and make that your goal one thing you will find out is that if you go in deeper  you will hit your inner intestines these are clenched inside you at first if your bf s dick is long enough it will hit this point and possibly penetrate it this feels different make sure you know how this feels  have i mentioned lube  get a big bottle   and have fun with it anal sex can be super awesome ,d01umfm,sex,lifestyle,1455629348.0,needs_a_shave,1.0,0.0,1,5,0.0

575,hi there so this probably seems like a shallow issue to have  but i want to get some other people opinions i m 18 and my girlfriend s 19  we ve been together for 4 months and things are going great we ve never argued  are honest about our feelings with each other and are in love   heads up  lots of detail  i just have one issue and that is that i go down on my gf a reasonable amount  at least a couple times a week sometimes even twice in 24 hours but she hardly touches my penis telling me penises are weird  now i understand that everyone feels differently about giving and receiving but i just feel as if this is a bit selfish of her i mean  we re both virgins  and its our first serious relationship each  but she gets to reach orgasm with my tongue in her vagina and i get told my anatomy is weird vaginas are weird too  at first she said that she thought oral and using hands on each others genitals was disconnecting that excuse disappeared when i started licking her out she s happy to let me go down there with her uncut pubes  but the one time she attempted to give me hand job she just stared at the ceiling and made a face and then decided she did nt like it and stopped  i m quite a selfless person  and i find it hard to ask for this stuff  but yknow i feel as if there s a real imbalance here i ll give her oral without a second thought because i know she enjoys it  but if i ask for anything i get told maybe later i feel as if i put a lot more effort into this part of the relationship than she does  and more than she realises  i do plan to be honest with her how i feel  but i m not sure how to approach the issue or what i can suggest i feel as if i d have more luck suggesting to have sex than for anything in return  so there you have it  thanks for reading my anecdote  i appreciate it looking forward to what you guys have to say ,465cqd,sex,lifestyle,1455666581.0,Lukai-9,8.0,0.0,1,42,0.0

603,you could try edging basically stimulate him  suckfuckwank be creative  for a set time eg 15 mins get him close to cumming  then stop everything just before he cums and i mean stop everything you both can not touch his cock until he does nt want to cum anymore after the 15 mins he can cum then as he gets better at it try to increase the time from 15 mins to 23 hours  it sounds horrible but learning how to edge helps me last longer i can keep going as long as needed then cum when i m sure she s had just about enough always leave them wanting more  aka finishing before the chaffing starts  as you get better at edging is all you have to do is stop thrusting for awhile or change positions  maybe if i m getting a bj i ll go down on her or say i want to fuck and the feeling eventually passes  i promise you he will thank you for showing him how to edge the orgasms are bigger  stronger and more intense after edging for 2 or 3 hours ,d01wrom,sex,lifestyle,1455633896.0,fleckofly,1.0,0.0,1,118,0.0

612,so here is the situation we have been married for 7 years we have a 3 year old girl on weekdays we are both very busy my wife gets up at 5am gets our 3 yr old ready heads out drops her off at her best friends house on the way to work i start work a little later then her so i get up at 8am get ready for work and head out my wife works from 8  5pm monday and friday and 8noon the rest of the week she also works every other saturday from 8  1pm i work every weekday from 10  30  6pm  occasionally we have sex but it feels passionless and so does our kissing she always just has her hands at her side and lips puckered for a kiss but no effort she got angry one morning when i brought up sex to her on monday morning and told me we are friends without benefits she was angry as she tells me she has so much to do in the morning i should nt ask for sex i am hoping that is the only reason she said that i told her that is not the marriage i want she tells me she has 0 libido  there are these libido increasing vitamins she tried for a bit and they helped but for some reason she stopped taking them and i do nt want to push that on her i m getting ready to go back to college for my mba and i feel like i am in a passion less marriage which is depressing she does so much each day as you can tell i try to shower her with appreciation and love and i buy her flowers i ve even read no more mr nice guy and am trying to see if those changes could help we have a cruise scheduled for october this year with our daughter being watched by my wife s friend i m hoping that helps some  i do nt want to live in a passionless marriage i need to figure out some way to get our passion back when we started dating she had insanely strong libido to the point she would want it 3 or so times a day and i had a hard time keeping up now i m lucky to get it once a week whenever i ask her why she loves me she always mentions she loves my brain  my heart  and that i am a great father i feel she has lost any physical attraction when i asked her about that she said i definetly enjoy your presence when you are near me i recently got a board game called  an enchanting evening  we played it together the night before vday there are spaces on the board game with physical activities and verbal activities whenever she got to a physical activity she would make a frustrated  ugh  but would still do what the card said maybe she was being silly not sure  anyways that board game has a rule whoever wins gets their wish fulfilled my wife cracked jokes her wish would be to go right to bed ugh my wife is completely unhappy with how she looks to the point she refuses to have sex with the lights on and she wo nt let me see her naked unless it s dark she also only wants to have sex doggie style when we do because she says it s the deepest penetration and her favorite but it s always the same if we have sex she goes to the same spot same position and there is no foreplay hell i ve offered repeatedly to lick her pussy but she always refuses i asked her if she dislikes her pussy licked and she says no i love it well anyways i won the board game so i had her have sex with me with the lights on in different positions with us facing each other and i told her repeatedly how beautiful she is during because i truly think she is nothing has really changed as of yet but i think her understanding i think she is beautiful is important also in 7 years of marriage that was one of the few times we had sex with the lights on  any suggestions to help revive my wife s passion is appreciated i know it s a long read thanks again,462aiy,sex,lifestyle,1455627037.0,Falcon68,8.0,0.0,1,1104,0.0

660,i think there s a distinction between calling someone a slut versus calling someone  my slut   the latter is nt meant to be degrading  because you re not trying to make the woman feel bad about herself it s more so you telling her that she belongs to you and praising her for being so good at catering to your sexual needs my bf will call me his slut when he wants to order me around but also when he s doing things for me like oral   i want to make my slut feel so good    i want to give my slut so many orgasms  etc   since she s into being dominated  ordering her to call you  sirmaster  can be just as effective without feeling like you re degrading the person  also  cuddling at the very end of your session might make you feel better because you get to remind her how much you love and respect her and how everything you did just prior was play  just some ideas ,d016vvx,sex,lifestyle,1455576345.0,throwawayacct963,2.0,0.0,1,55,0.0
661,so on valentine s day we wanted to watch a sexy film and after googling a bit we decided to watch love  the film involves a couple who has loads of nice sex  who then decide to have a threesome with their new sexy neighbour  me and my boyfriend have been talking about having a threesome with another girl for a while we have discussed our limits  at first him not doing piv  eventually changing to him not cuming inside of her   this was mostly to satisfy his fantasy and for me to explore something i ve been interested in trying for a while  now after watching that scene which starts very hot but ends up with the guy paying much more attention to the other girl i feel so terrified because it i imagined my boyfriend enjoying fucking some other girl like that and i just started crying after the scene i had this horrible pit in my stomach and felt so emotional this is something that would have turned me on so much before when i was single  he was amazing about it  comforted me  and even mentioned before i could say anything that he thought too much time was spent on the other girl i trust him completely we went to a strip club once where they payed a lot of attention to me and i even encouraged them to pay attention to him as well i was fine with that but the thought of him wanting  desiring another girl freaks me out completely he has watched chatturbate while we were having sex a couple of times and i keep worrying that he wants someone else  what should i do  should i go along with it and hope that i will be okay with it  like the strip club  or put a stop to it  i love him so much and i want to make this happen for him  but that scene wo nt get out of my head ,45x9eh,sex,lifestyle,1455553813.0,Throwawaythrsm,447.0,0.0,1,153,0.0

705,long story short  i ve been dating a girl for nearly three months christmas evening was the first time we had sex  i kinda fucked it up by being to rough in the beginning  but we did nt had any problems we experience right now we talked about it  it s alright and we both acknowledged we still have a lot to explore and experience together since then we tried to have sex several times  but the following problems started to occur   i had a boner the entire foreplay  but when i m done with going down on her and we want to have sex my dick goes into malfunction and ca nt get it up  happened twice    at three points during foreplay while she was giving me a bjhj i just felt i lost control over my dick and felt like i could ejaculate instantly  edit  these points feels like my dick takes own control and i just can not make it relax or regain the control  my stamina is nt the greatest  but the more sex i have the better it becomes last summer i went from 105 kg to 85  i still go to the gym 5 times a week but i drinkeat what i want  still healthy  but no strict schedules anymore   so i do nt feel physically insecure i m not confident either  but i m happy the way i look muscular with a lil bit of fat so i feel like it cant be my physical insecurity  before i started dating her i had a relationship for 3 years with a girl that literally destroyed me from the inside out in the end i was able to cut myself loose  but the sex with her was without emotions  passion or anything related to love perhaps that was how i acted on christmas evening  i m thinking that the difference of sex could be the cause  besides that  i m also in my last year of my bachelor degree i was supposed to start my internship the first of february  but did nt make it due to an accident on work in my 2nd year  so i missed a lot of stuff it s kinda stressing me out i m really fed up with college  and i just want to ace my internship and get that degree i really feel stressed because of this i ca nt  or i do nt even know how to relax anymore it s on a regular basis on my daily mind  she is really open and acceptant towards it during valentine i surprised her and i made it really romantic but after hours of kissing  talking and foreplay both events started to occur we talked about it and she is really open to ideas  suggestions or solutions  also  i really love her we had several fun dates before i invited her to my house on christmas eve  i like to talk a lot with people before bonding with them she had the same she loves me too so you could say things might work out for us i really want to know how i can solve this  since i ve never experienced this before halp ,4625a4,sex,lifestyle,1455624079.0,Martiaz,8.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

708,you do nt want to ask her to stop  but it s hindering sex for you and so  i d assume  that means you want it to stop  you ca nt really have both  if she s not ready for it  that s understandable obviously it s a fantasy of hers and this is the closest she s comfortable getting right now  but  if it s turning you off and making sex feel fake or forced  it s totally acceptable and understandable to talk to her and ask her to tone it down  you can always try and get over that feeling she s trying to share a fantasy with you and make it sexy for you both maybe focus on the aspects that are arousing to you  and play on those when you re in the moment guide her with dirty talk of your own and make it into a role play that is hot for you both it may not be on the table to act it out anytime soon  but that does nt mean you ca nt have some fun with it in a way that enhances sex for you both  you guys obviously have open communication where sex is concerned  to be able to talk about threesomes and work out boundaries is a big step for a lot of couples  so this should be no different  sit down and let her know how you feel you like when she talks dirty  so reaffirm that you enjoy it and find it hot  boost her confidence  let her know it is nt her that s  ruining  sex for you  but let her know how you feel about certain subject matters  as gently or bluntly as you need it to be  and find a way to work her fantasy and your needs into sex equally maybe she reserves that kind of fantasy talk for certain times  and does nt bring it out all the time maybe you guys do certain types of role play surrounding that fantasy on certain occasions so she can fulfill that but you do nt have to think about it all the time  maybe you guys can chat about and come up with ways to make it more sexy and enticing for you  even  for couples that do nt share certain fantasies  compromise is a pretty reasonable request and is nt uncommon saving certain types of play and fantasy for certain nights  so everyone gets what they enjoy and it does nt become stale or constant  is a pretty decent proposal  if it is nt something you think you can get into and get over  i d bring it up with her ,d02i92t,sex,lifestyle,1455664167.0,TheDingalingus,1.0,0.0,14,4676,0.0

716,my so and i have a group of close longtime friends that we hang out with almost every weekend we are three committed malefemale couples in our early twenties recently  there has been underlying sexual tension in the group that no one will openly admit to the other night  we all got drunk and insisted we play strip poker after some initial reluctance  we all ended up losing our clothes and became increasingly comfortable after we finished the game  there was some awkward  now what   conversation we instinctively moved on to truth or dare the whole game was a series of dares consisting of  lick this  bite that  kiss her   all the while beating around the bush everyone was clearly enjoying themselves and having a good time  here s where the problem is by the time we were done  it was 5 in the goddamn morning and i was sober  but everyone else was still drunk then one of the couples suggested we draw straws for  sleeping arrangements  in threesomes in separate bedrooms it was a  whatever happens happens  type of deal the idea of separating couples and possibly taking advantage of my drunk friends set off a few alarms we have also seen a few issues of jealousy and loyalty come up with each of the couples over the years my so and i told everyone we were sober and we did nt feel comfortable with the current situation  but we were adamant that we had fun  everyone was definitely interested in taking things further  and my so and i found the idea of it very exciting would it be completely out of the question to act further on this  we still do nt think splitting up is a good idea  but would group sex be a good way to break this escalated tension  or will continuing down this road sour our friendships ,45zpfc,sex,lifestyle,1455581860.0,5intheGoddamnMorning,48.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

747,i do nt really know about the dangers that much but i have been choked  both sexually and nonsexually and i like it  when it s sexual  not the other way  so i have some experience  i prefer when it s pressure on the bottom of my throat  that way it cuts off some oxygen but it s not painful and if it gets too much you can just tap out and at worst i get a bit lightheaded  which is a bit fun  and cough a little as long as the girl knows her limits and does nt want to actually take it too far it should be fine you should be able to trust her to tell you when she s had enough  pressure on the top of the throat i find painful because you have the hard adam s apple there and pressure on the sides is more suffocation and less pleasantness  tl  dr choke around the bottom of the neckthroat  not the top or the sides safest and most pleasant imo ,d01re72,sex,lifestyle,1455618455.0,bananalien,1.0,0.0,1,80,0.0

753,my gf has had a lowered libido for a long time now and we are both interested in trying to get it back to where it was during the first year of our relationship any advice is appreciated  more info  i asked her for permission to ask this on reddit  eventhough it is anonymous  and she it more than interested in hearing any possible advice sorry for the incoherent rant that follows  our relationship was strained for such a long time  arguing once every few days  having almost no sex  maybe once a month or less at times  that we actually broke up after a few days i wanted to get back together and try and make it work by addressing the things that she had said were making her crazy  most of which having to do with me being lazy in one way or another we also talked about our poor sex life and i told her that sex is very important to me  but i was nt going to pressure her to have sex until she was more comfortable with me and trusting her libido in the first year of our relationship was incredibly high  higher than mine for sure she actually cites the fact that i would turn her down too often as a reason for her decline in libido she also switched her birth control from the pill  yaz  i think  to nuvaring anyway  we ve been back together for about a week now and we ve had sex twice the first time was after a few drinks and unfortunately she admitted to the alcohol being a factor even though it was only 2 or 3 drinks the second time was today  and she told me that she was nt incredibly interested initially and was doing it more for me she always claims to have a great time and orgasms every time  but she is never in the mood before hand and would never initiate i often worry that maybe i m coming onto her too often and that maybe wanting to make out often puts her off or is annoying we have an incredibly open line of communication since getting back together  and we talk about how things are going at least once a day to make sure there are nt anythings unsaid or desires left unclear  i know that letting her build her libido again  if that s possible  is going to take time so i do nt want to rush it  but i just want to make sure we are on the right track  and find things we can do or try to increase her sex drive i ve also stressed the importance of not wanting her to feel like she needs to give me sex  but at the same time how sex is an important issue in a relationship and she agrees she wants a higher libido and for us to get back to our old ways when things were good ,460rjg,sex,lifestyle,1455596652.0,Throwaderp2,45.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

1180,my girlfriend and i love each other very much she used to be very turned on by me  and would throw herself onto me whenever we saw each other but recently she s stopped wanting to have sex with me or getting turned on by me at all  her reasoning is that she has a fetish  not just a turnon  but a true canonlyorgasmbythinkingaboutthisthing fetish it s the result of something that happened to her a long time ago both this past event  as well as the fact she developed a fetish from it  deeply trouble her because she ca nt orgasm without thinking about it  and thinking about it makes her feel bad  she is afraid to orgasm at all she has kept this fetish from almost everyone  even her exes however  one day she told me  i did nt find it strange at all i found neither the event that caused the fetish nor the fetish itself to be abnormal or bad although the event itself was a bit unfortunate  it was not uncommon  and certainly nothing along the lines of rape or something terrible like that i am fairly certain the far majority of people would not find it strange and yet my girlfriend finds it incredibly strange  and thus bad this was manageable in the past because she would still enjoy sex with me even if she didn  t orgasm but now she  s begun to associate me with the fetish  because i  m one of the very few people who knows when we have sex  or do anything even remotely flirty  all she can think about is the fetish and how she wants it to stop and so she  s found herself more turned on when random guys flirt with her than when her boyfriend does  i can think of two solutions  1 my girlfriend gets rid of the fetish my girlfriend made one attempt at this in the past she didn  t orgasm for over a month in hopes she would move on from it and orgasm to typical sex things but then she tried masturbating  accidentally thought about the fetish for four seconds  and immediately orgasmed and felt terrible about it  2 my girlfriend stops associating me with the fetish i don  t actually have anything to do with it besides the fact she told me about it and i don  t feel any differently about her now that i know it but unfortunately you can  t easily logic these things away  does anyone have any advice  specifically regarding solution  1   i know people have gotten rid of fetishes in the past we love each other but dating won  t be feasible if she can never get turned on by me again but gets turned on by random guys ,4660lt,sex,lifestyle,1455675912.0,toucan1000,0.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

1283,okay so me and my gf just had sex after eight months  we broke up in the meantime  and it was pretty much the worst sexual experience of my life  we hung out all day and i pretty much got hard whenever she hugged me but when it came down to business i could nt even get an erection  we had smoked some weed prior and because i was afraid i would climax to fast i had mastrubated a few hours earlier and had also drank a few wines  i d have hoped the alcohol would have made me last longer and maybe help the nerves but that did nt seem to have worked because when i finally managed to get an  semidecent  erection i came after a few strokes the whole thing was pretty terrible  i have nt had alot of experience this was maybe my 10th time having sex for me  my gf is more experienced and likes it rough  and i just wan na do right by her  the point is that im very upset about the whole thing  it already took alot of my courage to initiate sex  but after this its gon na be even harder to gather the courage to do it  it s just i waited so long for this moment and i m very upset that i blew it so my questions are  how do i recover from this blow to my ego how do i last longer and how do i get better at sex in general basically how do i make sure this does nt happen again ,4654dx,sex,lifestyle,1455663371.0,Pm_me_advice_plsgod,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0
1284,gt  smoked some weed i had mastrubated a few hours earlier and had also drank first  all of this is going to do more harm than good if you re feeling this uncomfortable about sex you re not going to be able to get and maintain an erections if you re high  wasted  and recently already jetted off  what you really have to do is relax your partner is probably nervous too you re in this together if things do nt go as you expect during sex  you have to be okay with it because  surprise  sex rarely goes exactly as planned anyway  try to stay sober remember that sex is more than just sticking it in and thrusting give your partner attention if you re having trouble getting an erection  stick with foreplay a little longer if you do nt think you ll be able to last very long  be sure to give your partner extra attention so they re satisfied as well  how do you get better at sex  practice helps  but the most important thing is to pay attention to your partner s body language if they respond positively to something you do  remember that and give cues back to them as well  it happens to all of us  no matter how experienced you are  something unexpected will still happen  and you ll have to learn new ways to react and respond relax take things slow when you get intimate  communicate  with your partner ,d02il3c,sex,lifestyle,1455664678.0,Calebu,1.0,0.0,16,5154,0.0

1485,you are normal we get lots of posts like yours here on rsex over on rsexover30  we were just cheering for a woman who posted this   can i just brag   had my first orgasmat 30   https  wwwredditcomrsexover30comments464eqycan_i_just_brag_had_my_first_orgasmat_30  hopefully you wo nt have to wait that long  but having orgasms is actually something a woman s nervous system has to learn to do  and different women develop and learn at very different rates unfortunately  girls and young women who orgasm easily tend to be vocal about it  while those who have never had an orgasm easily to either lie about it or keep quiet  so it can feel like you re the only one being left out but the reality is much closer to this  gt     your first orgasm     if you re like most women  you probably experienced that blissful moment somewhere between the ages of 18 to 24  according to sextoy company adam amp  eve  which conducted a survey that found 45 percent of women crossed the finish line for the first time during that age range  so the first key point is to relax you re normal there s nothing wrong with you  however  just because it is normal to have your first one in your 20s does nt mean you need to wait until fate happens to bless you by accident if you have the motivation  there is a lot you can do to speed the process up  the first suggestion has to do with stress stress blocks orgasms i m capable of outrageously intense continuous orgasms  yet i had a year when stress in my life skyrocketed and my libido went to zero no interest  nor arousal  no orgasms stress can hammer your capacity for sexual arousal down to almost nothing  so can anxiety and depression and the medications for them  but most people are more aware of it when they have those disorders  you re at an age when stress tends to peak for many reasons  and young people are often oblivious to how much stress they are carrying around all the time they also tend not to have learned effective strategies for reducing it and coping with it so that s a good place to start  this is a post i wrote a few months ago   https  wwwredditcomrsexcomments3szkfuadvice_seem_to_have_lost_my_very_high_sex_drive  about the most effective ways you can manage stress to lighten the load and make it easier for your to get really turned on  my second recommendation is a book   becoming orgasmic   it first came out in the 1970s and was revised in the late 80s  so a few of the earlier chapters sound a bit dated but most of it seems very modern and the program it describes has been proven to be highly effective it laid the foundation for modern sex therapy for orgasm problems there are many newer books available  but most of the good ones are based on the same selftraining process  i ve included a link to the book in this collection of  the best resources i ve been able to find for preorgasmic women and their partners   https  wwwredditcomrsexcomments3hinx2advice_girlfriend_has_never_had_an_orgasm_whatcu84s28  you should be able to find a lot of stuff there to help you  my final suggestion is to be more patient and take a lot of time with both masturbation and sex stop rushing and putting expectations and deadlines on yourself block out large chunks of time and pamper yourselfget your partner to pamper you  the second half of the orgasmic learning program outlined in the book i just mentioned involves relaxation techniques and mutual massage  and it overlaps a lot with the practices in modern tantric sex  which involves slowing sex way down to make it more intense there s a discussion of that overlap in this article   becoming orgasmic  tantra as therapy   http  moderntantrablogspotcom201505becomingorgasmictantraastherapyhtml   and it includes several quotes from  becoming orgasmic  on the importance of taking enough time to get fully aroused and to really enjoy the process  without being goal oriented or feeling like there s some sort of time limit  the authors say this about the selfimposed time pressures that prevent many women from having that first orgasm  gt  at this stage  people often experience concerns about  letting themselves be pleasured you may feel that you  require an undue amount of stimulation in order to feel pleasure  arousal  or orgasm women in particular tend to feel  abnormal  because of the amount and kind of stimulation that they need they may feel that they are being selfish and fear that their partner is feeling bored  detached  or resentful fears and worries of this kind can put tremendous strain on your sexual sessions and it can prevent you from feeling pleasure or even experiencing orgasm  gt  knowing what is  normal  helps to relieve many of these fears from our experience in helping women learn to have orgasms  we have noticed that when a woman first becomes orgasmic  it is not unusual for her to want and need a substantial amount of time and stimulation  an hour is not unusual when we say stimulation  we are including hugging  kissing  massage  and breast and other body area pleasuring genital stimulation itself may vary from a few minutes to fortyfive minutes  we are not including intercourse here  i ve talked to a number of women in your situation  and many of them have told me how having concern or guilt about  taking too long  and  being too much trouble  distracted them and caused them to lose their arousal  stopping them from reaching an orgasm  just because they had much higher thresholds than their partners did  and were feeling guilty about taking much longer to orgasm than the men did  or than they felt a woman  should  but our first orgasms often take  much  longer than  normal  ones do later on  and putting a selfimposed timelimit on arousal is a great way to prevent yourself from ever getting there  i hope some of this helps and that you ll soon be enjoying many happy endings  good luck ,d02tsqn,sex,lifestyle,1455682390.0,ShaktiAmarantha,1.0,0.0,36,4291,0.0

19757,i think you have a case of sunk cost fallacy the fact that you consider all that you ve already put into the relationship the main reason  or at least first you least  you do nt want to break up is telling someone truly happy would say  i am still so excited to be with her  and almost every interaction leaves me feeling better about the world and my life   that said  you just need to sit her down and talk to her  and if she gets angry  or says that you just want sex to often  ask her to lay out what her ideal setup looks like  how she thinks things should be prioritized  what place sex has  and go from there if she is nt willing to have a discussion about it  then you have a bigger issue  that she is nt interested in open and honest communication  and then you need to sort that out with her  then loop back to the sex topic ,d02vgaq,sex,lifestyle,1455685418.0,waluvian,1.0,0.0,1,2784,0.0

41936,dear sexual beings  i have been with my girlfriend for a year or so and we started to have some sex problems a few months ago i have a lower sex drive than her and she feels a pressure when we have sex more specifically  she is the one that almost always initiate it and she feels insecure about my desire for her she feels she s forcing it on me and that i only have sex with her to please her on my end  it s hurtful to see her this way  as i do want her and i do fantasize about her  but i fail to satisfy her needs  tonight  we had a long conversation and she wants us to try abstention  no more sex her rational is that it s already a source of anxiety and awkwardness for her and it might be better to just put this aside all together we both agree that our relationship is much more than just sex  but it is still nonetheless a scary endeavor i personally feel it can be a slippery slope  we might get to a point where turning back and going back to a regular sex life would be very difficult i would also like to add that neither of us are religious per say  so this decision is not spiritually driven it is only an attempt to solve a problem that seems to become persistent  i would welcome any advice  thought and shared experience  so please do nt hesitate ,466otr,sex,lifestyle,1455685564.0,Noos-xH,1.0,0.0,80,14,0.0
