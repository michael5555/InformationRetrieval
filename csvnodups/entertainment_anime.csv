34,35,34.0,if you read a lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things  check out this anime you ll like what you find  i m martinthedragon  and i thank you for reading ,464r02,anime,entertainment,1455658733.0,MartintheDragon,117.0,0.0,1026,699,0.0

68,69,68.0,holy fuck what an ending  amuro and char s duel was intense with both their mechs being destroyed kind of sad that the white base was destroyed i was not expecting char to blow off kycilia s head off this episode i was kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing series and i ll look forward to watching zeta gundam with you all ,d02gc58,anime,entertainment,1455661388.0,TreyTrey23,3.0,0.0,413,17147,0.0
69,70,69.0,i like how amuro casually abandons his favorite gundam when it becomes half useless it s just a robot afterall  i remember he operates the console to set autopilot for the last shooting  but it s not there might be movie or manga addition  amuro notices that zabi is the true enemy  but it s different from char s standpoint amuro is still talking like just a soldier hoping piece  whilst char s motivation is mostly from his personal revenge and he also now finds newtypes are more dangerous  to whom  whole humanity  or himself   so it s understandable they ca nt reconcile and join  the episode title escape is appropriate  besides amuro wanted to confront char clues in white base just fight to survive and escape from a baoa qu alive they are now federation soldier but still have civilian mindset from episode 1  overall i see the last few episodes feeling rushed  but do nt find its openendingness is unsatisfying or i say it is not an open ending  considering the scope of the story is one year war amuro survived the war along with the members of white base  char completed his revenge it is a good conclusion ,d02o8gx,anime,entertainment,1455673446.0,ukainaoto,3.0,0.0,1848,4313,0.0

109,110,109.0,you know that feeling when you re you re watching a seasonal anime that s somewhere between average and good  and all of a sudden the newest episode blows you away with how great it is  in the twoandahalf years i ve been watching simulcasts  i ve experienced that feeling a number of times and it s always a pleasant surprise unfortunately  not all anime are able to carry that narrative momentum through to the end  so what episodes  whether you simulcasted them or not  stand out as the gems in otherwise average  good not great  or bad shows  some that come to mind for me are  when supernatural battles become commonplace episode 7  i have a feeling this is going to be a popular answer simply due to  hatoko s amazing rant   https  vidme8yy5hatokosrantfrominoubattle   and the biggest crime in the show  is that   s  she loses her memory of it in the next episode and her concerns are brushed to the side   inoubattle is a show that s so close to being great if only it focused more on its strongest elements  danmachi episode 8   the fight   s  between bell and the minotaur was without a doubt one of the best scenes from anime in 2015 it elevated my opinion of the series from being an sao clone to a show that has genuine character development and is capable of heartpounding action   classroom crisis episode 11  classroom crisis got off to a slow start  but it picked up steam as it went culminating in this amazing episode  nagisa s   s  plan completely fails  kaito is asked to help the company build weapons  atech is on the verge of being disbanded  and nagisa is stabbed as a last second cliffhanger so much happens in this episode to move the story to its low point before the triumphant finale  but the scene that steals the show is the kiss shared by nagisa and mizuki the buildup to it is great as nagisa spills his guts to her  as is the cute and touching payoff one of the best kiss scenes i ve seen in recent memory   aldnoah zero episode 12   i remember   s  being blown away when i watched this episode for the first time the action throughout the episode was great and the genuine tension in that last scene was unbelievable the creators certainly achieved their goal of making a memorable cliffhanger too bad the second season wipes away most of the consequences from this episode   charlotte episode 7  oh charlotte it had its faults in the earlier half of the show   perhaps the most boring maedarequisite baseball episode i ve seen  but i was genuinely enjoying it too bad the last 3 episodes had to ruin all that still  charlotte did give us some great things  most notably best girl nao and episode 7   because maeda built up the relationship between   s  yu and ayumi  her death did have an impact both on the audience and on yu it was interesting watching him fall further into depression and revert into his powerabusing self from episode one and just as he s about to cross the line into drug abuse  nao finally beats some sense into him and reveals that she d been watching him the whole time that scene not only brings yu the catharsis he so desperately needs  its a big moment for nao showing how much she cares for him   this is how you do it maeda  not by expecting an emotional reaction out of the audience after a single rushed episode ,465038,anime,entertainment,1455661863.0,FierceAlchemist,32.0,0.0,3499,3456,0.0

123,124,123.0,first time watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as fuck in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out yet ,d02j182,anime,entertainment,1455665373.0,mmreviews,2.0,0.0,44,4639,0.0

391,392,391.0,nagi no asukara is ummmwell its pretty  i have alot of gripes with the anime honestly and i was sorta surprised at its mal score of  85 and its imbd 76 so for the sake of this post i ll say what i liked first    visuals   like i said the show is pretty the setting of both shioshishio and oshiooshi are beautiful i especially liked oshiooshi s rusted metal and rural setting the character movement is really fluid  no pun intended  and if you can get over the clannadesque character design you ll be fine    sound   the music has this mystical water theme to it its kinda hard to explain but i really liked it the ops and eds are incredible and fit the show well  i was actually planning on watching this just because of  opening 2   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  inkszyr99um    plot  without the romance    it was okay  i really liked akari and miuna s arc because of how sweet it was but  essentially the whole show is  we re gon na do an ofunehiki  which is nt bad watching the characters come together was really nice the racism between the land dwellers and sea critters was erased towards the end thankfully also theres stuff about the sea god which is sorta hard to fully explain    now thats everything objectively good about the series   this show is a shippers nightmare  so based on the first 13 episodes kaname likes chisaki who like hikari who likes manaka who tsumugu who likes  the sea    its essentially  a freakin chain hikari is so loud mouthed and verbally abusive but he has a heart of gold and can actual think deeply about himself and others manaka is a crybaby thats just as rash as hikari chisaki is super aggravating because she the classic romance character that   refuses to confess   i get that she does nt wan na change the group dynamic  but its really annoying kaname is the same way but at least he starts trying to discuss their issues once the great sleep is about to happen and he openly confessed to chisaki in front of her parents which was really badass  also everyone runs alot  you d think these chicks would join the track team considering how many times they run away crying and running are what you re gon na see alot but considering they re just 14 i guess i ll let it slide  so if you were like me  throughout the 13 eps you were shuffling how to make the pairings work in a way which everyone is satisfied then the ofunehiki happens and ruins your plans so you have to start over since manaka is pretty much shafted for half of the 2nd half and everyone grew up you re pairing was probably this miuna x hikari  kaname x sayu  and chisaki x tsumugu but nooooo manaka has to show up  i really wanted her stay gone or keep her amnesia just for the sake of my pairings and apparently so did the other characters  then there s the bs  i was gon na call them plotholes but nah so its revealed that tsumugu liked chisaki from the get go cuz of some metaphor that she s the sea or something then he says that she liked him even way back then  yeah this caught me off guard  which ca nt possibly be true  but she admits that she did    this coming from the same chick that said  she still loved hikari even after the 5 year timeskip also  manaka is revealed to have loved hikari but when kaname tried to discuss it in the classroom  she fucking runs off saying she  does nt understand     then later on when hikari hugs her she pushes him back really hard yet  she still loved him at that time  its so contradictory  to be honest  if you re not interested in the romance then there is nt much here in terms of story and plot the romance is the essential meat of this show the way they treated miuna was awful  she tried hard but lost to plot also everyone can get ena which is nt really explained at the end but whatever  if i had to give it a rating i d give it a 6510 the characters really hurt this show and the plot is kinda flimsy its not like hanasku iroha or shirobako where the sol is where the show really shines nagi no asukara is heavily dependent on the romance which is nt that great honestly that being said  i still loved the show it was fun seeing how things would pan out    tl  dr   watch the show  its romance is stupid but its still a fun series to watch and its pretty  sorry if my writing seems sporadic ,465ohb,anime,entertainment,1455671267.0,OseiTheWarrior,2.0,0.0,1,2298,0.0

400,401,400.0,like most people probably  i ve got a lot of ideas i think would make for good anime i ve even come up with what i think are legitimately animesounding titles  if you ll permit me to use them    our hisandher harem is nt working out    it s about a pair of childhood friends and current twentysomething otaku neets who try to help each other form harems their idea is  since they re both socially awkward around the opposite sex   he ll  help form the male harem for  her   and  she ll  help form the female harem for  him   what they do nt count on  however  is that real life is nt an anime  and real people have complex personalities and hopes and dreams and desires of their own so even though they successfully manage to essentially form a pair of perfect harems  none of the harem members are falling in love with our protagonists  and worse  some of them are falling in love with each other  it s basically a comedyparody series that ends up growing a heart as the protagonists come to see their desires as resulting from their own social problems and inability to form normal  healthy relationships they start working on those problems and it actually works  they end up going on normal dates  and have a few relationships their wouldbe harem members eventually become good  close friends instead of mere objects of desire  the series ends with one of the protagonists in a long dry spell and the other breaking up with their most recent significant other  but this is nt a sad ending  because they ve improved so much and have this great group of friends  and know they ll find love in the future and are better  more complete people for all their romantic struggles    the classic marraige project   a young man and woman in their late twenties who ve had no lasting romantic success in life decide to try an experiment even though they have no attraction to one another  they ll start a relationship together  and see if love develops  the title comes from the fact that throughout most of human history  marraige was the  beginning  of a relationship you did nt fall in love and  then  get married  you got married  usually for familial or financial reasons  and were expected to eventually fall in love and most did  and society worked just fine it s only in recent times that the idea of lovefirst relationships and  dating  were even considered  and just like the marraiges of old  this one works  too  they do fall in love  though there s lots of ups and downs and one shortlived end to the experiment along the way it s basically a series that examines and questions conventional wisdom about love and relationships  and looks at other ways for people to connect and fall in love that society ignores  i ll post more later i ve got lots of ideas ,d01ufgw,anime,entertainment,1455628876.0,jnb64,17.0,0.0,14396,6262,0.0

569,570,569.0,i think the unusual contradictions we re getting with grimgar is because of the production studio  a1 pictures they mass produce shows  they pumped out 12 shows in 2015  10 in 2014   they re throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and seeing if a few will stick on paper  grimgar wo nt stick it sounds boring but this time they picked a great director but little budget but the execution is great but it s sooooo slow paced that s because a1 only gave the director little material  i m really liking grimgar it s alluring plot is nt everything the world they ve built up and the characters are good enough it s slow but that s what defines grimgar ,d02d1x6,anime,entertainment,1455656962.0,gettothechoppaaaaaa,5.0,0.0,460,17466,1.0

572,573,572.0,i think its a sign of nakamura s talent that my mind did nt really grab on to how many pan shots there were in that episode until you pointed it out that goes to show how he intersperses the pan shots throughout the episode so they do nt stand out rather  they flow naturally with the deliberately paced direction of the series  my favorite one was definitely the threepeat tilt up with yume and haruhiro against the wall the way we progressively get closer to haruhiro s face emphasizes the increasing emotion of what he s saying and you can tell they are nt zooming into the same shot 3 times  decreasing the image quality as they get closer like some anime do the third tilt is clearly a new drawing with a different expression on his face ,d027y09,anime,entertainment,1455650176.0,FierceAlchemist,1.0,0.0,3499,3456,0.0

772,773,772.0,example  so i really like god eater  the description from myanimelist   set in a postapocalyptic japan in the year 2071 the world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the aragami an organization known as fenrir was made to exterminate aragami using god arcs   weapons made from aragami cells those who specialize in exterminating aragami are known as god eaters their god arcs originally could only keep a single form  however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and blade form since then  they have been classified newtypes and the previous as oldtypes  oh wow  special monsters that can only be killed by special young adults with special powers now i m sure with enough generalization you boil any anime down to a vague and unoriginal sentence  so what i m asking is for anime that you really enjoyed despite you personally looking at the description and thinking  there is so much originality here it must have been written by someone who s lost their hopes  dreams  imagination  and spirit  edit  also anything with the description  normal guy does normal things until suddenly mysterious hot girl appears ,466410,anime,entertainment,1455677202.0,CaptainBenza,4.0,0.0,2225,36141,0.0

795,796,795.0,i definitely think panning shots and in general  direction that involves the camera moving more often than not is a trait of western television as you said in the essay  there can be many uses for this technique to draw attention to fanservice  give multiple views of how characters feel in one moment and the most utilised one in my opinionto keep the audience s attention now when i say it like that  it does sound rather negative and to a degree it is this form of direction displays how the average person these days ca nt stay focused on television series  that being said  i do in fact like this technique still it has the ability to liven up scenes that would otherwise be dull and uninteresting with no movement keeping the viewer engaged is important and even though i do nt like how our attention spans seem to be decreasing  this is a good way to keep the audience s attention where it should be grimgars director is doing a splendid job in this regard especially considering how slow paced the series is ,d01wfz9,anime,entertainment,1455633285.0,cycle112,11.0,0.0,866,7845,0.0

808,809,808.0,might sound stupid but what i mean is if i watch an anime where i try out both sub and dub first and enjoy them equally  i would alternate them every second episode so for example  episode 1 i watch it in sub  then watch it in dub in episode 2 and then back to sub for episode 3 and so on this was the case for me with fullmetal alchemist  brotherhood since i thought both versions were excellent  so what are the benefits and downsides to this  well you get to appreciate experiences of both versions and you get the best of both worlds when a particular character voice you like exists in a specific version same goes for narrative scenes where one of them might be better in a another language the downsides could be that it might hurt your immersion with the anime series  it does nt affect me honestly  when listening to a specific language also you might miss some details or moments in a certain episode that you did nt watch  through that version  when alternating  so has anyone of you tried doing this especially when an anime has both great dubs and subs  otherwise  what do you think of the idea in general ,465124,anime,entertainment,1455662199.0,IcarianStyles,2.0,0.0,255,1784,0.0

839,840,839.0,every little facial expression misaki showed in the second half of the episode put me on edge there s everything in there  jealousy  at asuka   anger  at shindou for not taking misaki seriously   selfdoubt  misaki does nt think she s good enough despite scoring against shindou   while everyone else celebrates asuka s achievements  misaki is the one who does not step forward  despite being the person who gets asuka to relax in the locker room just before the match  this episode does highlight something else too  asuka s ability to perform well has more to do with the fact that she has little to no prior experience of fc and thus is nt bounded by traditional ways of approaching it  it takes a great amount of mutual trust to convince someone to close their eyes and listen to instructions the way that masaya and misaki did i suspect masaya has been in a similar situation before  i m excited for the next two to three episodes to see how all of this plays out i wonder if there will be enough time to deal with the fallout of this episode and set up for a somewhat satisfying conclusion given that we re already halfway into the season ,d0139m1,anime,entertainment,1455570951.0,Laxaria,42.0,0.0,808,20610,1.0

963,964,963.0,hey  sorry i missed yesterday s thread i m so excited to watch through this  and very thankful for you hosting this  pittman  so thanks    sora has already won me over with her determination and resolve  she will do anything to make her dream come true  and now she has to prove it  she even earns the respect of those who were against her  and even gets acknowledged by layla  layla really does seem quite diabolical  but i m sure it wo nt go on without being explored and dug into perhaps she too holds kaleido stage so dearly that she would nt want it s reputation tarnished by those with no experience  i look forward to seeing more of her  and to seeing the whys of her actions  kalos is great  and his interactions with sora have been very funny  i do nt think he s a perv i hope he seems to have big hopes and exceptions for sora  he clearly sees something others do nt good guy kalos  i love   dio   fool  the spirit of the stage  i really was nt expecting this kind of twist  but i really do enjoy and appreciate the little supernatural twists in otherwise normal circumstances ala dera in tamako market it just adds some spice  sora s hard work and guts are making this a great watch so far i m really enjoying the comedy the exaggerated iconography in anime has nt grown old for me yet  which kaleido stage does very well  and interactions between sora and fool have been hilarious to watch i look forward to more what i m most hopeful for and looking forward to is seeing strong bonds of family and friendship form between the cast as we go on  the animation feels very similar to both gintama and cardcaptor sakura in many ways  and looking at anime news network there seems to be a number common key animators  but it only credits them for certain episodes i think the similarities are pretty uncanny though any one else think this  or can confirm or deny any common key factors  thanks again pittman  for hosting ,d02gmqo,anime,entertainment,1455661802.0,Sajamba,4.0,0.0,7474,43569,0.0

1159,1160,1159.0,my favourite part of the new op would probably be the ending part the first few punches matches the music  which i think is pretty legit also  jotaro s chain actually moves while his stand is punching  that flesh bud looks really gross tbh  at least dio is making people like him instead of mind breaking his followers  i really like how they frame dio in this part they ve never shown his face  but he always has this aura of power surrounding him i d follow dio tbh seems like a cool dude i think we should also all praise dio tbh  this is some intense surgery not a fan of the tentacle going through jotaro s skin though  nice job bring back the hamon joseph even says the overdrive line to accompany it  jotaro pls just say you care about the dude and you want to see him live stop being a tsundere  wow holly  stop triggering joseph you should really keep your superior american name  lel  ofc the size is the same between joseph and jotaro  you know  avdol s robe makes it look like he s floating when he walks slowly  poor holly   those are some artistic skills there jotaro once this is all over  you should be a painter or something  oh god  joseph is brushing holly s teeth fucking monogotari series makes me think of something lewd when this happens  joseph is such a good father  oh dang  kakyouin the milf hunter doing all of this just for holly  glad to see that speedwagon s legacy lives on through the speedwagon foundation  kinda weird to just randomly choose a card what if jotaro got  fool  or something also  seems like the naming scheme is just a tarot card plus their colour  but at least the names sound cool  nice pose at the end  legit ed i ll miss roundabout  but walk like an egyptian sounds pretty good too  wait  dio also has hermit purple how     he does nt even have to break the camera  not really sure what i can say for the screenshot of the day  so i ll just say it looks nice ,d01au0i,anime,entertainment,1455582611.0,randomdudeman12,26.0,0.0,99,10326,0.0

1556,1557,1556.0,  first time viewer   episode 43 so this is the final episode it s been a ride  we begin with the battle continuing and the fight between amuro and char escalating  kai and hayato have broken through  and the gundam has actually lost an arm in the fighting holy crap char actually pulled that off  the white base lost an engine  as well  and is landing on a baoa qu this could be a breakthrough  or it could be disasterous  welp mirai crashed it the white base is nt getting off a baoa qu anytime soon  amuro s still chasing after char  while kai and hayato are actually defending the white base  char s nonred ms has been reduced to a head  and he s in full retreat suppose that fight s over  except not really because zeta and cca exist  kycillia is surrendering a baoa qu  and retreating to side 3 either that wo nt work out  or the series has no real ending   it s the zabi family that must be brought down   erm  amuro  that s what char s been trying to do all series long  in other news  the gundam is rekt and amuro is fighting on the ground now the fight continues between amuro and char  except it s a gunfight now  which is  by late1970s standards  very well choreographed and animated the animation s come a long way since the beginning  in the last 20orso episodes  i have nt ever looked at anything and thought  quality   and now the guntank and guncannon are rekt as well only thing left to total is the gfighter but that s been abandoned anyways  and sayla is looking for char on foot  when did amuro and char start swordfighting  anyway  sayla finds them  and they end up in a deep discussion about newtypes  their potential as a weapon of war  the fact that they should nt be used as a weapon of war  and char wanting amuro to join him  and sayla just wanting them to stop fighting  and then they get inturrupted by an explosion  amuro s trying to pull out the spike from his arm  like that s a good idea  it s not  char is nt going to let kycillia go free  then  and he s grabbed a rocket launcher dis gon be gud this will probably be the last time char and sayla see each other in the episode and  from what i ve heard  sayla does nt show up much in zeta or at all in cca  yep kycillia is dead  by means of rocket launcher headshot from char so endeth the zabi family  with the exception of minerva  in the end  char could only take down two zabis personally nice to know sunrise did nt forget garma existed  sayla thinks char s dead ouch  amuro s falling down a shoot  slowly bleeding out  and is now trying to stay alive suddenly  lalah advises him from beyond the grave  and amuro suddenly sees the white base crew fighting  and can now telepathically communicate with sayla  and the rest of the white base crew  apparently he s aiding their escape  coming up with plans to make sure the crew of the white base does nt die horrible deaths  i love how amuro refers to fraw as  my dear fraw bow   and the white base crew has officially abandoned ship  and then ship went boom rip white base you served bright and co faithfully o7 goddammit amuro ca nt be caught up in the explosions  can he  yay  amuro s alive  he s in the core fighter  flying alongside the evacuation ships the white base kids are still awesome  amuro s acknowledged where the white base crew is as his sorta home  jumped out the core fighter  landed on the evacuation ship  and left so endeth this series  it is the year 0080 in the universal century following the battle of a baoa qu  a peace treaty was signed between the earth federation and the republic of zeon the year of brutal fighting known as the one year war had come to a close now  on to zeta  i m pretty sure this is the longest reaction i ve ever written six and a half hundred words of nothing  discussion question  yes  i liked the ending ,d02crgi,anime,entertainment,1455656570.0,Applebane,3.0,0.0,1,477,0.0

1790,1791,1790.0,well  it was good watching this with you guys  fun hanging out with the firsttimers as they enjoyed the dark  tragic  silly ride with us  my final thoughts on this series is about why newtypes appear it always seemed to me to be more about war than a natural occurrence or maybe it s minovsky sideeffects  either way  i think it s something related to technology  because amuro clearly gained his ability while on earth  as almost immediately upon returning to space  he started exhibiting the newtype flash ability where newtype powers  notoriously are nt as effective  or at least it seems to me   and if armies  later in the series  are able to  major plot spoiler   s  create cyber newtypes with similar abilities    then the process must be fairly simple to work out  apart from that  i ca nt wait for more gundam is easily my favorite anime franchise for some reason i just ca nt get enough on to the thrills and spills  spoilers i guess   s  mostly of blood and jerid s girlfriends    of zeta gundam ,d02j51j,anime,entertainment,1455665534.0,taking214,3.0,0.0,0,0,
1792,1793,1792.0,on today  s episode of gundam  it  s the final showdown between amuro and char  and what a fight  that fight when through so many more phases than i expected first  the fight through space with their robots  shooting each other they destroyed both their mobile suits both the gundam and zeong got absolutely wrecked they continue into the base itself  and both jump out of the mobile suits to start a zero gravity gun fight  which was awesome we cut away from the fight for a while  and when we return they  re suddenly engaged in a sword fight  what   when did that happen  i want to see how they got to that point in the fight but they did the whole stab each other thing in the fight  before the arrival of sayla and the continuing destruction of the base forces them to stop amuro got stabbed right through the arm  and char nearly got stabbed in the head  except for the helmet he always wears all in all  it was a pretty awesome duel i  d say it was a pretty good way to have the long fight between amuro and char come to an end  at least for now  the white base got shot down  and crashed onto the base that was a desperate fight to defend it again  i constantly worried about the crew  s safety especially as they had to resort to handtohand combat to defend the white base thankfully  they were able to escape before the white base got destroyed goodbye  white base  you served the crew well for the entire series  amuro was able to communicate psychically with everyone in order to help them escape and so that he could later escape it was gratifying to see him come out of that base  safe his words to lalah  that he had a home he had to return to before he could go see her again  really resonated with me once again  the white base crew has become a family they care about each other seeing them develop into such close comrades who work so well together was great  char completes his revenge he took a bazooka to kycilia  s face  damn  that is harsh  i  m pretty sure i saw body parts flying around after he shot her but  that takes care of most of the main zabi family just beware of dozle  s wife and daughter widows and little kids are dangerous in this series  i don  t believe char is dead for a second he may have gotten caught in the middle of all those explosions and be missing  but i don  t think they  d kill off a major antagonist offscreen  especially since they gave a lot of detail on the other deaths he  s alive  the war is over i  d like to say the series did an excellent job of showing just how massive the scale of the war was at the end there the gundam  guncannon  guntank  and the white base got destroyed  but the federation still won the war effort was much bigger than a single ship or a couple of mobile suits they were one part of a larger war effort  i did notice that at the end  when it said the war ended  we were now in year 0080 based on what the discussion threads have been saying  i know the war began in january 0079 looks like it lasted about a year  and it managed to destroy half of humanity  at the end it also changed what it called zeon it called it the republic of zeon  instead of the principality of zeon looks like it returned to being a democracy after the deaths of most of the ruling family  gt  discussion question of the day this was a pretty fantastic conclusion to the series i know that the ending was rushed  since the show got canceled and had to end sooner than expected  but this really works as a pretty great ending it concluded the char and amuro fight in a satisfying way  and ended the war i m happy with this ending ,d02cptw,anime,entertainment,1455656506.0,Great_Mr_L,8.0,0.0,0,0,

1803,1804,1803.0,char killed the woman who killed space hitler  down goes the last of the big zabis  gundam does such a great job of making a powerful  pulsepounding final battle while also making it entirely unglorious it was an amazing battle  but it was nt a cool fight  it was a great rendition of how messy  wild  dangerous  and enduring real warfare is it s the middle of this massive siege  and neither side is doing any well at all but the federation is still moving forward  and the white base is just one front of this entire hellscape  and it s so crazy that even though they ve survived so many mobile armors  battles  and megaparticle cannons in the past  even their super machines ca nt handle so much concentrated destruction  char and amuro are the only two are managing to keep up their performances  but since they are pitted against each other  they wind up crippling themselves anyway what other rivalry could possibly provide a battle between a disembodied head and a headlessonearmed body  and have them still be the most dangerous ones in the war  and have that not even be end of how far down they beat each other  i giggled when amuro called fraw bow  my dear fraw   he did nt forget they were great childhood friends after all ,d02vf1c,anime,entertainment,1455685349.0,hmatmotu,1.0,0.0,0,0,

1827,1828,1827.0,so  we have dragon ball  let me highlight episodes for you that are impactful to the series i ll leave the minor episodes out  this is a catchuprecap after all episodes  listed by importance  also  kai gives the raw manga story  but has weak music bruce faulconer is a god the heavy rock makes it so epic the problem is that version of dbz is being erased dragon ball super is still fan sub d  but i m going to only give you the episode past the second movie time to watch it   side note  if you wish to go back a few episodes go ahead  these are highlights i ll try for spoiler free since this is to catch everyone up in a short time                                                                                dragon ball series                                                                               ep125  kid goku reaches korin s tower after going through some shit popo kicks his ass he then meets kami and you should start from this episode  ep126  goku is stuck at the lookout  you get a glimpse of emperor pilaf  i think he s pretty insignificant to the story imo you can skip most of the episodes after this you wo nt find much action  since pilaf was destroyed after the tournament this is actually a fundamental point of the series goku becomes op later  we know that  but it s this episode where you understand his training  and my next episode recommendation is when he returns as a young adult  ep133  after his training with kami  goku shows his first appearance to the others he is 18 now  and this episode does nt show much fighting it pretty much just starts his true origin to becoming what he is today i can give an exact episode  but this and a few episodes forward  make it great to watch i suggest it  ep143  spoiler    read at own cost   so i hope you took time to watch the entire tournament  it s pretty good  kami fought piccolo in a disguise  piccolo sealed kami  goku is the next fighter and it goes on for a few more episodes he wins of course or else the db franchise would have ended so  after a young adultteen goku beats him  a few episodes later  147 the rest are fillers between chichi and goku   the series moves on to dragon ball z  the fight with raditz                                                                                dragon ball z  episode run down                                                                                ep1  raditz makes his appearance  ep3  piccolo and goku form an alliance  ep6  goku starts to travel snake road  fighting side plot characters till he reaches king kai  gohan trains with piccolo for the rest of the series till the vegeta first encounter arc  ep22  the fight between both vegeta and nappa start against the zfighters  ep29  goku appears  ep37  they defeated vegeta who escaped  goku is hospitalized they then go to namek to resurrect tien  yamcha  piccolo  and chaozu  i ll edit this if i need to but summary  they arrive and get their asses kicked even after gohan and krillin teamed up with vegeta goku has been training his way up to 100x gravity on his destination to namek  ep66  goku arrives at the end of the episode if you took time to watch the previous episodes  they show gohan s progression to surpassing vegeta  ep75  piccolo is revived  the nest few episodes is his encounter with nail  the strongest namek on planet namek  ep79  gohan and the others pushed freeza to his first transformation gohan shows his power and holds him back  these next few episodes are worth watching as you see gohans growth  and piccolo being a badass  ep95  goku transforms  enough said watch from here on out and will continue my episode reference to when future trunks makes his apperance                                                                                after freeza                                                                               ep119  future trunks makes his appearance at the end of the episode i recommend you start with ep 120  ep122  goku meets trunks  trunks tells his story  goku and tunks fight for a few seconds  ep129  vegeta s first ascension into a super saiyan  ep146  goku awakens and the episodes after this  which i suggest watching the previous episodes since future trunks is involved in them  are filled with some pretty nice action the time chamber is introduced now  i m going to skip a shit ton of episodes i am going to give you the episodes where gohan transforms  and if you have seen most of the freeza saga  you will appreciate him a bit more                                                                             i am not sure which episodes to leave out because really  i personally feel that after cell chapters  they are quite good but if you want to skip them to the monumental sayin parts this is where the guide will go from im also sorry to rant about this  but  kai  was great for the story line  but the music i mentioned at the beginning of this post  made what was dbz epic if you have any luck finding it  the bruce faulconer soundtrack is a must it will give you the full heavy rock experience i have no idea why  funimation  did what they did  but movie studios are corrupt and honestly  how are they so fuckin stupid  i want to make this a rant post but my goal is to catch people up on the series only american fanboys  sorry japan enthusiast  i watch a lot of anime but i dare you to complain about the soundtrack                                                                                 majin buu saga     ep245  goku goes ss3  the most epic moment ruined by the  kai  experience due to the soundtrack now  speaking about this episode and not the music  goku breaks his sons ss2 transform in the cell games he rekts majin buu s shit  but is limited watch the episodes before it  his temporary body cant handle the stress it provides   this is a big episode skip but there are many  plot vital  points between them i will get yelled at for leaving some episodes behind  but we need to catch you guys up on the series  ep263  gohan has just finished his training with the supreme kai he unlocked his hidden potential and absolutely destroys majin buu  ep268  vegeta and goku argue while fighting majin buu  mystic gohan  absorbed about fusing  because  well  they are full blooded sayin s and have a stupid amount of self pride the episode after this they fuse and you need to watch it  ep278  not really an episode worth watching if you are looking for ass kicking action  but this gives credibility to the first battle of gods movie   that s my bulma   a good episode to watch aside from the plot progression  i hope you watched every episode after mystic gohan fights buu  this has to be the best please do nt skip them watch every episode after 268 i beg you  this episode is nt filled with much fighting  but it will rekindle your  bromance  between vegeta and goku also this is the final episode  almost vegeta and goku finish him off or dbz super wouldnt exist reading this  watch the full episodes to finish                                                                           dragon ball super  this one is tricky  i wont give episode  s anymore  but i stuck through the facepalms if you want to skip the revival of f and catch up  i will give you the episode to do that i can not go any further  you need to suffer as i did if you are a coward then skip the episodes gt                                                                              poster opinion                                                                            dragon ball super is growing on me  and i wanted to give it up  brave if you dare  i can say  despite some cringe  it s going to get good  ep27  where the second movie ends  but i challenge you to watch 127 ,4653pu,anime,entertainment,1455663123.0,StyAwhileNlisten,5.0,0.0,0,0,

2749,2750,2749.0,isn  t jojo supposed to be crazy rich  by the looks of things he has a considerable hand in the speedwagon foundation  so it seems like it would be pretty reasonable for him to be able to get a private plane to egypt  especially in circumstances such as these i think it a bit weird how calm the aftermath of the crash seemed there are several dead bodies on boardall with their tongues ripped outand the word  massacre  written on the wall in blood surely that should be getting some attention  this episode really showed the whole  no cannon colours in jba  thing  with magician  s red appearing green  and hierophant s green appearing yellow fancy art guy got to try out being blonde for much of this episode  something which i imagine many people would be jealous of i have a friend who tends to fret over dying her hair  so she would love the chance to try out a colour like he did  i liked the way that hierophant s green was deployed this episode the airplane setting made it reasonable for green to be deployed over the others  without it feeling contrived and the way it finished off the beetle showed off its potential in planning ahead and laying traps  so far it  s not quite on the level that jojo was last season  but there  s still time on that subject  i was glad to see jojo use some hamon last episode  and i hope we get to see him predicting some lines in the near future  i thought the french guy to be incredibly rude it  s one thing to kill some people  but he interrupted their meal to do so and if there  s one thing i hate it  s having a meal interrupted what  s more  he was a dick about it he made comment of how long they must have spent preparing the food  and then threw it all on the ground  just to be a dick just let them finish their meal french how hard is that  i have no doubt that he  ll get over his dickishness though  and that  s because he  s the 5th character in the op it took me a few episodes to make the connection with fancy art guy due to the changing hair colour  but with this guy it was more obvious to me  speaking of looking at people  s characters  did someone say  let  s take a look at how the tarot cards which stands are named after relate to the owners of the stands   yes someone did it was me  now that the link to the tarot has been explicitly stated the show is saying some things about what the cards mean  but i think i still have some things to add   also  quick side note  what  s with the whole  the stand bearing the x card  thing  did i miss something  it was shown that stands are named after cards  but that makes it sound like bearing a card is a much more serious thing it makes it sound like jojojo pulling the star should have been treated with a lot more fanfair  tower of grey is pretty obvious  doubly so due to it being a one shot character the tower relates to high scale destruction and collateral damage  and that  s exactly what tower of grey and its owner seem to specialise in it kills people  a lot of them  and destroys things while doing so the fact that the crashes are caused as a side effect of the killing  as well as that they were going to bring down the plane in the effort to kill our main characters  both relate back to the collateral damage thing  then we have jean frenchname with silver chariot the speed relation is obvious  but beyond that we don  t know enough about jean claude van french  s character to say how they correlate so i  ll do the opposite  and try to predict his character based on the card  we already know that he  ll be joining the team  and i reckon that he  s going to be filling the funny guy slot  i mean this in the archetypical sense  rather than saying that he  s going to be a laugh a minute comedian or something   jojo filled this last season with his quiping and his wit  but by the time of this season he  s become a crotchety old man who  s worried about his daughter one of the big themes of the chariot is that it  s a unifying force  bringing people together to pull in the same direction based on this i see jean luc pierrecard as being the one who works to bring people back together after a disagreement or falling out the one who can make jokes to keep up the group  s moral  that kind of stuff but this is just a prediction  and i may well be proven wrong  i  m looking forwards to tomorrow  s episode  though i  m not sure if i  ll actually have time to watch it tomorrow i want to see how french frenchington ends up joining the team  and if they ever get to finish their meal ,d02lce9,anime,entertainment,1455669044.0,discdeath,9.0,0.0,120,11717,0.0

3249,3250,3249.0,these things are just getting longer and longer sorry about that  but i m finding myself with increasingly much to say about the show  i can never quite tell if jba is expecting the watcher to be surprised at the times that the characters are i felt this last season with the revelation that lisa lisa  so good they named her twice  was jojo  s mother  and i feel it again now with the revelation that jojojo  s mother has a stand  last season it had effectively already told us of the parental relation  but still treated it as if it was a big revelation smokey in particular just could not shut up about it in this case we were showed that holly had a stand in episode 1 there was that whole bit where jojo was saying that anyone with joestar blood had the birthmark and a stand  the camera showed the birthmark on all of jojo  jojojo  and holly  and then showed them all glowing whilst talking about how dio had somehow given them stands  i get that the characters are surprised  because they aren  t given the same facts that we in the audience are but it feels somewhat like the show expects us to be equally surprised  i suspected the relation between the stands and the major arcana due to the names  magician  s red  and  heirophant green   i can  t remember if hermit purple was named before this episode   but it  s nice to have it confirmed whilst i have no interest in the tarrot for fortune telling purposes  i know a fair amount about how it related to storytelling archetypes  and i can definitely see how that  s being applied in the series  magician  s red is a fairly obvious one avdol has had his stand longer than any other character we  ve yet encountered he  s experienced and knowledgeable with regards to them  and brings that knowledge to the others  even going so far as to name jojojo  s  and presumably jojo  s as well   in addition he  s a fortune teller  which should be pretty obvious  hermit  s purple relates to jojo in the fact that he  s an old man  who already done his primary adventure after his adventure was over he withdrew from it  hence his lack of training with hamon over the years now he  s finding his new adventure  one seen in a different light  on eof protection rather than destruction   and passing his wisdom along to the new adventurer in so doing  hierophant s green is a bit of a strange one  and seems like more of a stretch to me i suppose his ability to control people could be seen as a parallel to the acolytes who typically follow the hierophant  but i  m not so sure i suppose i don  t really know that much about the bloke yet  so i might have more insight in future weeks  frankly i  m a tad surprised that jojojo  s wasn  t based on the fool  that typically being the main character of the story however i suppose that might have been a bit too on the nose  also jojojo seems like the sort of chap who might take exception to that i  m less certain with thi sthan i was with previous ones  but i  d say that star platinum relates to the fact that jojojo has his true self hidden from the world to an extent  particularly his relationship with his mother   and his journey will reveal it also that the part of him which fights evil through the use of his stand is who he  s really meant to be i admit that that sounds quite weak  but the star has always been one of the archetypes which i had a shakey understanding of  then for the other two stands in the series i  m not sure what holly  s would be based off  at a guess i  d say either the moon or the hanged man  but frankly i  ve no idea however i feel pretty confidant that dio  s is going to be called world  s chartreuse or something like that the world is the last card in the tarrot  and also typically considered to be a very powerful character when viewed in archetype so it makes sense that dio would have it also we see dio using the spirit photo which jojo uses  and what  s more his stand takes on the appearance of purple vines while he does so i  m going to hazard a guess that dio  s stand can mimic the powers of other stands  which would fit the idea of the world very well  i  m still loving this series  as should be obvious by how much i had to say about the names of the magic ghosts   and really looking forwards to how part 3 is going to turn out so far it  s making a good start  and while part 2 is my favourite so far i wouldn  t be surprised to see that change over the coming weeks ,d01bpkf,anime,entertainment,1455584036.0,discdeath,24.0,0.0,120,11717,0.0
