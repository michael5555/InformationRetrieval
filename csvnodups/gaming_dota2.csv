190,191,blademail does nt reflect damage against a hero with bkb active which ta wants to get as a third item usually after blink and deso also i do nt believe you can blademail sleight of fist damage so it would really only help against wr except she would normally ult you after a like a blink shackle catching you off guard and you d be unable to trigger your blademail so that probably was not the best item choice  i ve noticed in a few pro games spectres go some combination of urn drum or aqi before going for a major item like radiance manta or diffusal it helps with early survivability and you can actually accomplish something with a lvl 6 haunt then if you are farming well radiance is a great follow up or if you are behind go for the diffusal or manta  the lack of a manta is confusing to me its such a great item on spectre and i do believe you can manta out of ember chains the yasha build up to it will help accelerate your farm as well  skadi would have probably been a better option than butterfly this game  as its been said  several of their heroes like getting mkbs  bkb would have probably also been a choice item against chains lift shackle shackle is strong against illusion heroes if you can target the right hero so bkb would have been great ,d02bdmd,dota2,gaming,1455654742.0,Zykor,1.0,0.0,1,1,0.0

205,206,gt  i  ve held off playing ranked because i think it  s important to learn a range of heroes before jumping into games that people take seriously it would suck playing ranked and saying  hey i can only play dp or dazzle  so  yea   most ppl actually do nt care about such things  they try to play ranked asap no matter if they know game mechanics  heroes  etc and they do nt care runining other ppl s games because all that counts is their own goals  thus  your attitude is respectable  but do nt assume others think the same way  they do not and you will be disappointed when playing ranked that s a promise so before you get into ranked make sure you are prepared for flaming tryhards and dickheads who do nt know much about dota but claim to be perfect players frustration incoming  ___ 1 to focus on certain positions can help to develop better understanding of heroes and mechanics in general yet  you should try to play many different heroes in order to find out what really suits you some heroes are more difficult than others due to more micro  others have many spells andor items  other aspects are last hit animations  attack range  attack speed  etc every hero is different and you will have to get a feeling for each of them give all  or most  of them a try  based on whatever criteria  be it nice plays you watched  interesting spells or things like that i would nt stick to certain heroes just because some ppl think they are great or easy to play or ez wins or whatever pick what you like and see how you manage usually an average about 10 games per hero is enough to decide if you want to continue playing or rather never touch that hero again this does nt mean you should play a minimum of 10 games with every hero before hitting ranked  just as a rule of thumb how to get a feeling  2 since attacks are hero specific learning to last hit and deny properly can be quite difficult some claim to start with rather difficult heroes  one of which would be zeus others would recommend easy heroes like wraith king or chaos knight  or whatever their personal preferences are pick a few heroes you feel comfortable with and just practice after some time you will be able to manage almost every hero usually ranged heroes have the advantage of distance to the creep wave  meaning you can last hit and deny a bit more comfortable due to not being directly in enemy hero range  3 less greedy laning comes with map awareness playing many support heroes actually helped me a lot with this because i was never tempted to rely on ss calls or other supports doing their job as support i feel responsible for everything that has to do with vision  so placing wards is just the beginning i watch the map constantly  calling ss for every lane  seeing rotations  warning allies  etc at the same time supports have less health so you play a bit more careful in general an alternative would be to play heroes that can be gankedkilled easily eg sniper with him you will have to have good map awareness and also work hard on positioning  or you will be destroyed so i d pick low hp heroes with bad escape to learn this lesson  4 what to do when  that s not really easy there is not really a  decision making 101   basically you will have to analyze a situation in order to make a decision does it make sense to tp  what can you do when you arrive  do you have the needed abilities to have any impact or will you just feed the enemy  how about your item progression  how much will it slow you down to help out  how much will it throw you back if you get killed  can you maybe achieve more by staying in lane  there are several things to consider  eg how good can you push  using that space your team creates for you atm  does enemy have tp  are you even safe alone  what can you farm  lanejungle  at the moment  many questions to ask and the answers are all very situational one thing i can tell you  never fight without vision  because in most cases it wo nt end well they only legit reason to dabble into the darkness of enemy territory is when using a smoke to either get a quick gank or rather to ward other than that there is a good chance you andor your team will be surprised  it is seldom worth the risk  5 learn how to stack in lobby quite easy once you know the timing also be aware of different neutral behaviour when attacking there is also a custom map that shows camp spawn boxes use that one to learn which spots can be used to block camps so you know where to place sentries to deward and unblock camps  6 when you are roaming you are usually playing a hero in safeoff lane a good approach is to have a smoke and ward vision of your destination then take the rune that is closest to you  if mid or other hero does nt need  and decide where you go from there ganking mid is never a bad idea  unless you andor your mid lack lockdown or chasing abilities you also want enemy hero to walk as long as possible  when far away from their own tower also keep in mind to smoke in an area where enemy does nt have vision  then circle around so you can come from behind and surprise enemy be patient  but do nt waste too much time waiting for the right moment if you decide to gank a different lane  proceed the same always have tp to escape or help out if other lanes are being pressured  always bring some sort of detection just in case a hero has invis  a hero who can escape by using an invis skill is not a dead hero and a waste of time and ressources  so you need to make sure the gank is successful by preparing the gank and make sure it works out use trees to cover you if possible additional to invis rune or smoke  just in case of some unexpected enemy visiting the lane you want to gank in general  best time to gank is as early as possible with all the needed preparation and items you should have at least brown boots  if not you need stunsslowany kind of lockdown or at least an orb of venom to maximize the time dmg is dealt make sure the lane you are ganking has enough mana and spells to participate  eg if your mid invoker has no mana and all spells on cooldown you do nt even have to go there so always check if your team mates are rdy and communicateannounce that you will come to gank so they do nt waste their manaspells on creeps  7 you should play heroes in ranked you feel comfortable with if 20 games each gives you that feeling you sure can play ranked but be aware that having played a certain amount of heroes and knowing their skills actually does not suffice  if i were you i d play the more common heroes at least once or twice to find out what they can do and where their limits are you will need that knowledge when you are facing them yourself there s nothing more embarrassing than running away from bloodseeker ult  or running into dark seer wall  sitting around in jakiro ult  or running away from undying zombies  etc in order to not panic and to make the right decision in fights you need to know your enemy so play more games with other heroes  maybe find 34 that you might like even more than your current ones  then go for your  20 games before ranked  thing  8 check out the regional channels if you have nt yet there might be also a subreddit  not sure though other than that there are plenty steam groups for certain regions  i m sure seattle or at least us west has some dota steam groups  other than that  good luck  mate  i like your attitude a lot and i hope you wo nt get too disappointed during the next few months always try to stay positive

459,460,whenever i play higher skill cap heroes in a game  i notice i do significantly better when my team knows how to play with that hero case in point is pudge someone stuns and then moves so you can hook is the proper way to play with a pudge however  i often see people not move to give an opening for the hook and those games are more often lost than the games where teammates do move the point is that stunning does not give free reign to hook  but a stunned target and open space allows for a hook now  positioning and sometimes lucky hook  hooking from enemy blind spots play into this as well  but the point is that you need to learn how to play with invoker and whatever play style that voker chooses  exort invoker make space via constant fighting and allow him to split push and pick off solo targets while quas wex calls for strong follow upstrong ability to kite from your team  ,d02suml,dota2,gaming,1455680755.0,Happymealify,1.0,0.0,1,-29,0.0

1129,1130,i m coming from a sc2 background where proplayer behave very friendly in games and i think that is a huge part of why the community is friendly and awesome  meanwhile i read on a daily basis about how rtz is flaming in pubs or today how sumail is feeding on purpose for whatever reason and then people crying that the community is so toxic  of course it is toxic when such players  who are supposed to be community idols  behave like this  schould nt they behave in the best possible way instead of making people believe that such behaviour is acceptable  i ca nt believe that their organisations and sponsors are okay with a behaviour like that as well it s sad  edit  i never said i want to compare sc2 to dota2  i just meant to give an example of a community where i think the pros had a big influence in how people treat each other  and who ever got 6 pooled or canon rushed knows how angry you actually can get in a single player game yet most people just leave the game and do nt flame   do nt misunderstand me  i m not saying proplayers are nt allowed to rage  i d never complain about them saying on stream st like omg this dude sucks  etc i mean we should nt be okay with them feeding like stupid or telling someone else to die or anything along those lines  i think there is a huge difference  edit2  i m really not here to discuss whether or not these proplayers should be role models  obviously i do nt think they should  but they are and that s the problem  edit3  everyone quoting charles barkley   i am not a role model just because i dunk a basketball does nt mean i should raise your kids  if said barkley would play a public game everyone would watch on tv and he d start scoring for the other team  you guys really think people would be okay with that ,461svp,dota2,gaming,1455616700.0,Ernie247,1831.0,0.0,1,1,1.0

1514,1515,games like dota 2 are really addicting to people who loves the idea of learning a new craft the game is full of hidden rules and ability synergies  and every character has its own gameplay style and quirks leveling up characters is fun and learning how to play with and against all of them is also pretty enjoyable in itself it s kinda like a longterm project for action rpg fans  the problem however is that dota 2 is also a teambased competitive online game  and people like you and me sometimes do nt really notice it until it s too late and we ve already put hundreds of hours into the game the  team game  aspect only kicks in when you have reached your potential as a solo player  which is when you re able to look away from your own performance and realize that you ll never be able to contribute more than 20  of the team s efforts in optimal situations  that was enough to make me stop playing i love dota 2 but i m not interested in playing competitive team games with complete strangers maybe this is the case for you too  and if so  the sooner you realize it the sooner you ll be able to find another game that fits your needs ,d020rph,dota2,gaming,1455640311.0,Amendel,1.0,0.0,1,645,0.0

1611,1612,what an interesting look at the other side of esports  what i see through all of this is the naivetyincompetency from both sides i can understand there may be some initial delay in setting up accounts but taking this long is not good enough especially when it appears the owner is willing to bring in his secretary to get things resolved  i do nt know what offices were closed but i work in financial services  the only day we were shut was christmas day and new year s day and this appears to be a financial matter  if i was the old manager i would not be sending one skype message every month or accepting a 2 minute chat at a tournament or whatever i would be having phone calls daily until someone gives me a timeline on when there is going to be movement although i am impressed everything has been logged  the owner making a comment about going on social media is stupid because they are not beholden to shareholders is interesting i think he needs to look at how much you can damage your brand  by these kinds of things  i honestly do nt put too much blame on either of the managers i assume they get involved because they love the game  not exactly a traditional career path so  on the list of requirements to be a manager of a dota 2 team i am guessing setting up usd accounts and knowing how and when to chase payments is nt high up  all of the hate is being thrown at cyborgmatt but this appears to have been escalated to the owner and his secretary and they seemed to have failed on their delivery and if the top of the chain is failing you then i guess things like this post are forced  i know it s often said that esports is shady but this does concern me as most often it appears that players get the short end of the stick couple that with how young the age demographic of players are  these are high profile players and hopefully it will be resolved and has nt affected them too much but i also wonder about the lesser known players that have been offered financial incentives and never recieve them because of some shady practices or they never push it as they simple are nt equipped to do so ,d02kdz8,dota2,gaming,1455667565.0,Fenrir89,11.0,0.0,1,2592,0.0

2055,2056,there are many ways to look at this  mmr is just a number if you win  it goes up amp  if you lose  it goes down thats all there is to it  if you are 22k mmr  it does nt mean that you are  bad at dota   it just means  you have room to improve improve things like lasthitting or focusing on objectives or timings or vision or mechanics or communication  attitude towards others  or even luck  getting bearable teammates   now  things being as it is  you ve admitted to yourself that you re  bad at dota   so the next quesiton  wellwhat are you gon na do about it  you can either quit  or attempt to get better  or just play casually and have fun and by having fun  i do nt mean trolling teammates kinda fun that maybe fun for you  but not for anyone else involved  instead  think back the first time you tried dota the basics learning each hero  figuring out what each spell does  theorycrafting items  comboes with other heroes  fun times try crazy shit with teammates ion shell a riki toss in a techies melee enemies  pick a huskar i have no mmr i am not consistent i got a 9 to 7 job and only get to play unranked on sundays it does nt bother me if i misplay i m not committed but i theorycraft every ounce of freetime i get always thinking up stuff  some too crazy to work out  i try out in my games  fail miserably  fallback to the original plan  try to win just take it easy its just a game you do nt have to throw a tantrum when stuff does nt go your way  keep calm and play dota,d021ovo,dota2,gaming,1455641616.0,forums_guy,1.0,0.0,0,0,

2064,2065,first time i picked up a moba was league my freshman year of college i went to school 3 time zones away from anyone i could call a remote friend or relative  and when that loneliness set in somehow playing league would abate it completely problem is  it s really like a drug in that it does nt help you feel any more fulfilledsatisfied when you re not actually playing the game of course that led to me abusing the game and playing instead of doing homework  going to class  or even sleeping  and it set me so far back in my planned career of becoming a doctor that at this point it s almost an impossibility  just because i set myself back so much that first year academically still 5 years later i m dealing with the consequences of neglecting all other aspects of my life to play a video game i weaned myself off of league by transitioning to dota 2  playing a couple thousand hours over the next 3 years which was actually nothing compared to how much i played league my first two semesters and allowed me to get back on track with my gpa  but once i found a fun group of friends at school i basically completely stopped playing competitive multiplayer games at all  it s really what you said op  a combination of momentary satisfaction at seeing your elo rise a few points at the end of the game to the pipe dream of someday playing professionally once i realized i could actually never stand professionally playing video games as a career my fire for playing competitively went out completely i still play a lot of single player games and will have a game i m playing online with others  but those games no longer consist of 4060 minute matches that lead to anger and frustration when lost i still stay subbed here to check out how the scene is doing and tune in to major tournaments from time to time because the dota2 pro scene will always be my favorite in esports but i ca nt justify the time spent actually playing this game anymore just jumping on for one match is nt fun for me  especially if teams are mismatched and the game ends up as a stomp  and i always have this feeling of lost time after a session of dota2 that is never there after i play a few matches of halo 5  i commend those that have the mentality to play this game at an appropriate and healthy level while still getting excited about the competitive aspect of it  but man i swear it s too easy for adolescents and young adults to get swept up in the craze caused by these games only to be left in the dust when they realize the time they spend playing does nt actually amount to any kind of tangible benefit in their lives and often causes them to neglect other much more important areas ,d020kx3,dota2,gaming,1455640039.0,Fildok12,2.0,0.0,28,6745,0.0

2884,2885,yes and then lets make pa s blur a toggle in case she wants a 100  chance of being denied then we can take coupe de grace and make it toggleable so you do not push the lane then take shakers aftershock and make it toggleable so that you can get the last hit on a siege creep without pushing the lane next we will take timelock  voids bash  and then make it toggleable so that you do nt mess up your last hitting then make greevils greed toggleable so that you have less of a gold bounty for dying so yea  im an asshole  but no  if this is a real problem for you then have better team coordination or gank from a different angle  it s not that big that you ca nt coordinate ganks,d02tsy7,dota2,gaming,1455682399.0,mcshrek201,1.0,0.0,0,0,

3748,3749,not really you re acting so naive  which can be more annoying than toxic players themselves sometimes the fact that you expect their organisations  to intervene in itself is silly sure e sports is growing  but as long as it is within the rules of twitch  the organisations should nt really have the right to intervene that s like your boss trying to tell you not to go out and party in the evenings  as long as it does nt affect your work it should nt be a problem the work of these pro s is to win i m sure flaming does nt make rtz or sumail or whoever your on about to lose tournaments  so forget that e sports is still growing and so does nt have the established foundations like other sports in something like football the rules will be stricter some greek footballer or something faced a lot of backlash after he did some nazi salute or something a few years back i remember  do nt expect the same from the e sports organisations in the meantime if you do nt want to see such actions  as already stated  do nt watch it no point being a bit   and complaining  also you re completely ignoring the fact that a lot of dota 2 players also play other games  where this toxic behaviour can be brought over from for example  i also play csgo  alongside a bunch of other games  and i flame and act toxic from time to time the way you described it so when looking at it  the actions of dota 2 pro s may be minimal in the grand scheme of things steam is a large gaming hub where there s a ton of games  not just dota  so trying to enforce such things could just end up being useless,d02dyjh,dota2,gaming,1455658170.0,boaahancock,2.0,0.0,1,24,0.0

3760,3761,a lot of this crap is just unfair  rtz actually comes across as a pretty decent guy if you actually watch his streams just because he has a few memes here and there and a bad image does nt mean the dude is nt legit  being ultra dedicated to winning  i am sure a lot of athletes are similar  but we do nt get a backdoor insight  into their thought processes in the heat of battle watch any football match and the reactions of various players when something goes wrong  or someone fucks up if we had a twitchheadcam i think a lot of people would be surprised at what gets said and done while a games going on twitch is unique in that we hear everything and see people vent  the fact that the dudes stream is  in my opinion  legitimately funny is incredible given the toxicity of the autists that get to the highest levels of the game  and rtz is unusually normal  in many respects compared with other pro gamers  i agree completely with the sentiment expressed by op though  it would be nice to have more rewards for friendly behaviour  but the truth is that these would be gamed continuing to tell people that being positive and friendly contributes to winning games is the right approach to the problem a  because it s true and b  because it is more likely to make even the most competitive douchebag think about their conduct  i do nt think trying to reprimand pro gamers  some of who are only kids at the end of the day  is the way forward ,d02bct5,dota2,gaming,1455654715.0,GazTheLegend,5.0,0.0,1,1167,0.0

3784,3785,yeah but sc2 had a population of korean players in which esports has been engraved into their minds since they were kids  the western players look to the korean players on how to conduct themselves in a professional or casual environment starcraft brood war has been huge since 20002002 where players conducted themselves professionally like physical athletes  although there are exceptions  of our culture  while most western players in most esports right now do conduct themselves professionally in any environment where eyes might be watching  some have nt accustomed to it  i do think its fine to be a bit cocky and carefree  one of the best esports personalities  mc was like this  and you can express yourself like this in streams but there s a fine line between being an interesting person and just a dick  regardless of whether or not you think they should nt need to  raise your kids   they are personalities and role models for future generations that sounds cheesy but its true especially for such a young industry western popular esports is only 6 years old since sc2 released and its important to give the right impression  as far as comparing dota and sc2  in dota you can blame your team for losing and being shit whereas in sc2  you can only blame yourself for your loss and flaming the other guy for winning is just funny ,d023pqv,dota2,gaming,1455644445.0,raz_daz,2.0,0.0,0,0,

3789,3790,i often hear the response from big pro players that they  do nt want to be role models   that s great and all  but when you re able to gather a large number of people on twitch to watch your stream  you re going to have some level of influence whether you want to or not  and a lot of these pro players are just too stubborn to deal with that reality it does nt matter if they want to be considered role models or not  they are to some people  and they have to deal with that do they have to change their ways  no  no one is forcing them  but they are going to criticized for doing so  and they ca nt escape that ,d022wof,dota2,gaming,1455643335.0,sstarkm,4.0,0.0,0,0,

3793,3794,i think that there are two polarizing majorities  though  that s not properly worded  in dota there are people that play the game to win  and people that play the game for fun  until there s a proper matchmaking system that allows people who only play to win to play with each other  the people that want to play for fun should have to endure people acting like assholes  because those who want to win  have to endure people playing like shit  that s the trade off i d rather not have foreigners in my us games  no bought accounts  english only  and when someone is bad  i wish i could banlist them and never play another game with them unfortunately  that does nt happen  so instead they have to listen to me call them trashcans  fuck you  also fuck rylai s blessing  it only gives me effigies ,d01tbwr,dota2,gaming,1455625778.0,Sufferix,8.0,0.0,0,0,

3796,3797,arteezy does nt get paid to teach you how to behave  he gets paid to play dota  if you need someone to set an example or teach you how to behave like an adult go ask your parents  pro players act like dicks in pubs because they play dota for fun and sometimes being a dick is fun do nt take it so seriously  people being dicks is just a core part of the dota experience because they need to vent their frustrations to play at their best in a team environment  besides  if sumail telling someone to kill himself on stream is somehow affecting your behavior in your own life then i suggest you take a step back and learn not to use a 16 year old gamer kid as your role model for mature behavior  also  just because someone is in the public spotlight does nt mean they should behave any differently or change their personality to suit your personal needs or desires they re human beings just like everyone else no matter how much you idolize them  and they do nt owe you fucking anything ,d01xtz7,dota2,gaming,1455635785.0,Remi-Scarlet,29.0,0.0,86,4300,0.0

16202,16203,what an interesting look at the other side of esports  what i see through all of this is the naivetyincompetency from both sides i can understand there may be some initial delay in setting up accounts but taking this long is not good enough especially when it appears the owner is willing to bring in his secretary to get things resolved  i do nt know what offices were closed but i work in financial services  the only day we were shut was christmas day and new year s day and this appears to be a financial matter  if i was the old manager i would not be sending one skype message every month or accepting a 2 minute chat at a tournament or whatever i would be having phone calls daily until someone gives me a timeline on when there is going to be movement although i am impressed everything has been logged  the owner making a comment about going on social media is stupid because they are not beholden to shareholders is interesting i think he needs to look at how much you can damage your brand  by these kinds of things  i honestly do nt put too much blame on either of the managers i assume they get involved because they love the game  not exactly a traditional career path so  on the list of requirements to be a manager of a dota 2 team i am guessing setting up usd accounts and knowing how and when to chase payments is nt high up  all of the hate is being thrown at cyborgmatt but this appears to have been escalated to the owner and his secretary and they seemed to have failed on their delivery and if the top of the chain is failing you then i guess things like this post are forced  i know it s often said that esports is shady but this does concern me as most often it appears that players get the short end of the stick couple that with how young the age demographic of players are  these are high profile players and hopefully it will be resolved and has nt affected them too much but i also wonder about the lesser known players that have been offered financial incentives and never recieve them because of some shady practices or they never push it as they simple are nt equipped to do so ,d02kdz8,dota2,gaming,1455667565.0,Fenrir89,10.0,0.0,1,2592,0.0

18914,18915,i feel you the game s not fun anymore for me and before i could realize this i had neglected my responsibilities on school and myself as well but the reason i kept playing so much back then was because i was so anxiousdepressed about going home without feeling like i ve accomplished something  note that i do nt have a pc and that i play on gaming cafes   i would play 8  10 hours  no standing up most of the time  no eating  because i could nt just leave when there are people that are lined up to play when you leavetime is done   ca nt respond to my girlfriend s callstexts  and the worst part is  i skipped classes for this so every time i come home and win nothing  i just feel super fucking cheap and feel like the scum of the earth i could nt even face my mother when she asks me why i come home late and just throw a fit at her when she did nothing wrong like fuck  anyway the only reason i stopped was because i got carried so hard just last month by a 7k mmr booster he did everything right while the lion on our team flamed him for almost half of the game for not joining team fights we lost most of the team fights but he carried us and  while we were having our celebratory fountain diving the lion praised him for playing really good  and the invoker  the booster  replied by calling us  dog shits  and    having no life     which got to me he s right i mean  i ve been playing the game since beta and i ca nt even go higher than sub 5k right now  and seeing him carry us made me think of how much time i ve lost and gained nothing over this but have just been chasing this number that wo nt probably mean anything more than what it is  so  after that i decided that i would no longer play the game  or at least not as hard as i used to i m still playing  but just at least once a week  for 5  6 hours  with breaks this time   i actually feel so happy that i ve made that decision i ve focused on so much more stuff other than the game  so yea i m sorry if this is too long to read but i just wanted to vent my feelings as well since i relate to op on the matter of having the game control their life glad for op on moving on as well  wishing you the best for the future    cheers  also sorry if there are unclear stuffs about what i m trying to point out  english is nt my main language  ,d01vlky,dota2,gaming,1455631574.0,da7thsin,6.0,0.0,4,3339,0.0

40644,40645,a lot of this crap is just unfair  rtz actually comes across as a pretty decent guy if you actually watch his streams just because he has a few memes here and there and a bad image does nt mean the dude is nt legit  being ultra dedicated to winning  i am sure a lot of athletes are similar  but we do nt get a backdoor insight  into their thought processes in the heat of battle watch any football match and the reactions of various players when something goes wrong  or someone fucks up if we had a twitchheadcam i think a lot of people would be surprised at what gets said and done while a games going on twitch is unique in that we hear everything and see people vent  the fact that the dudes stream is  in my opinion  legitimately funny is incredible given the toxicity of the autists that get to the highest levels of the game  and rtz is unusually normal  in many respects compared with other pro gamers  i agree completely with the sentiment expressed by op though  it would be nice to have more rewards for friendly behaviour  but the truth is that these would be gamed continuing to tell people that being positive and friendly contributes to winning games is the right approach to the problem a  because it s true and b  because it is more likely to make even the most competitive douchebag think about their conduct  i do nt think trying to reprimand pro gamers  some of who are only kids at the end of the day  is the way forward ,d02bct5,dota2,gaming,1455654715.0,GazTheLegend,4.0,0.0,1,1167,0.0

42250,42251,i feel you the game s not fun anymore for me and before i could realize this i had neglected my responsibilities on school and myself as well but the reason i kept playing so much back then was because i was so anxiousdepressed about going home without feeling like i ve accomplished something  note that i do nt have a pc and that i play on gaming cafes   i would play 8  10 hours  no standing up most of the time  no eating  because i could nt just leave when there are people that are lined up to play when you leavetime is done   ca nt respond to my girlfriend s callstexts  and the worst part is  i skipped classes for this so every time i come home and win nothing  i just feel super fucking cheap and feel like the scum of the earth i could nt even face my mother when she asks me why i come home late and just throw a fit at her when she did nothing wrong like fuck  anyway the only reason i stopped was because i got carried so hard just last month by a 7k mmr booster he did everything right while the lion on our team flamed him for almost half of the game for not joining team fights we lost most of the team fights but he carried us and  while we were having our celebratory fountain diving the lion praised him for playing really good  and the invoker  the booster  replied by calling us  dog shits  and    having no life     which got to me he s right i mean  i ve been playing the game since beta and i ca nt even go higher than sub 5k right now  and seeing him carry us made me think of how much time i ve lost and gained nothing over this but have just been chasing this number that wo nt probably mean anything more than what it is  so  after that i decided that i would no longer play the game  or at least not as hard as i used to i m still playing  but just at least once a week  for 5  6 hours  with breaks this time   i actually feel so happy that i ve made that decision i ve focused on so much more stuff other than the game  so yea i m sorry if this is too long to read but i just wanted to vent my feelings as well since i relate to op on the matter of having the game control their life glad for op on moving on as well  wishing you the best for the future    cheers  also sorry if there are unclear stuffs about what i m trying to point out  english is nt my main language  ,d01vlky,dota2,gaming,1455631574.0,da7thsin,7.0,0.0,4,3339,0.0

106654,106655,this is really bad you d think that in general esports business is very shady and not many people can share information with the public so a team like secret would be able to show how it can be done  but apparently not  this is a major hit to the brand if you ask me having no strings attached to an org was a major point for people to root secret not only because of the players  but also because of the idea behind the team  this just seems like it s just safer to go with an org if you are a successful player rather than trying something in your own  edit  i also generally do nt like when stuff like this gets posted on social media money problems should be privat affairs  but god damn it has been over a year for them to pay people accordingly ,d02hzcw,dota2,gaming,1455663759.0,g0ggy,20.0,0.0,2293,6482,0.0

106673,106674,what an interesting look at the other side of esports  what i see through all of this is the naivetyincompetency from both sides i can understand there may be some initial delay in setting up accounts but taking this long is not good enough especially when it appears the owner is willing to bring in his secretary to get things resolved  i do nt know what offices were closed but i work in financial services  the only day we were shut was christmas day and new year s day and this appears to be a financial matter  if i was the old manager i would not be sending one skype message every month or accepting a 2 minute chat at a tournament or whatever i would be having phone calls daily until someone gives me a timeline on when there is going to be movement although i am impressed everything has been logged  the owner making a comment about going on social media is stupid because they are not beholden to shareholders is interesting i think he needs to look at how much you can damage your brand  by these kinds of things  i honestly do nt put too much blame on either of the managers i assume they get involved because they love the game  not exactly a traditional career path so  on the list of requirements to be a manager of a dota 2 team i am guessing setting up usd accounts and knowing how and when to chase payments is nt high up  all of the hate is being thrown at cyborgmatt but this appears to have been escalated to the owner and his secretary and they seemed to have failed on their delivery and if the top of the chain is failing you then i guess things like this post are forced  i know it s often said that esports is shady but this does concern me as most often it appears that players get the short end of the stick couple that with how young the age demographic of players are  these are high profile players and hopefully it will be resolved and has nt affected them too much but i also wonder about the lesser known players that have been offered financial incentives and never recieve them because of some shady practices or they never push it as they simple are nt equipped to do so ,d02kdz8,dota2,gaming,1455667565.0,Fenrir89,12.0,0.0,1,2592,0.0
