760,761,ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster ,d015bhj,food,lifestyle,1455573964.0,Aevum1,36.0,0.0,10609,38002,0.0

3362,3363,ok  you cant use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster ,d015bhj,food,lifestyle,1455573964.0,Aevum1,37.0,0.0,10609,38002,0.0
