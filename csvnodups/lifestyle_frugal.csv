33,34,i m not sure rfrugal is where you want to seek information for this particular transaction you re asking if this a good deal for a car that fulfills more than just your needs in a vehicle if you need four wheels and a roof  no the car is not a frugal purchase or great  deal  if you have 17k to spend and want a small suv  no it still is not a great deal however  if you want a toyota highlander that is not exceptionally old  has a reasonable amount of miles for the model year  and is available for sale it is worth considering understand that having been a fleet vehicle means that at one time it was a car owned by a company and driven by multiple drivers that may have abused the car  hence the slightly higher than average miles per year  it also means that there was most likely scheduled maintenance checks and repairs done in order to keep the vehicle on the road to transport said potential abusers this company also probably had a milage cap on when they would sell off the vehicle before repairs were costlywhen value would nose dive personally if you are not mechanically inclined i would stay away from any former fleer vehicles  they are great deals on auction but there is a lot of inherent risk and potential cost in these vehicles ,czyhjwe,frugal,lifestyle,1455375867.0,Whiskey_Jak,4.0,0.0,1,6,0.0

325,326,hey buddy  i started working at your age too one thing you should do is watch your small checking account grow to like 500 or 1000 after your first grand then you will be so reluctant to just blow it away it feels really good to say that you have made 1000  and then it becomes easier to say  let s go for another 1000  then spend it on something after you get that next thousand it will be even harder to blow that away  so you will just slowly spend here and there  but never more than you make eventually  you will be at 5000 before you know it at that point  then you can decide whether you want to invest 80  of it in an index fund or a nice blue chip stock that you think will do better in the next 5 years since you are young you can afford to invest more of your money  more risk  because you probably wo nt need that   4000 immediately it could grow to  8000 in a few years or it could shrink to  2000  but its a risk you do nt want to miss at your age  tldr  reach your first 1000  then 20005000 choose to either invest it in stocks  or funds  i would do index   or into something like a car  enjoy maybe 10  of your paycheck on electronics  hobbies  or whatever you do to keep you happy ,czzaji1,frugal,lifestyle,1455428574.0,CalamariDude,6.0,0.0,59,18,0.0

443,444,ideally  you d find a car that s  almost  new if someone buys a car and sells it to you the next day  it s functionally a brand new car but you d pay thousands of dollars less for it  of course  very few people can afford to buy a brand new car every couple years  so such occasions are rare  i think there s an argument to be made for buying a brand new car you know it has nt been abused and it s going to take a long  long time to develop any sort of flaw an old car can end up costing you more than a new one if you constantly have to pay for repairs on it  plus the hassle involved with it  does nt start when you need it  have to go to the garage 23 times a year  etc  is a major pain  a used car could conceivably be in great shape and serve you very well for many years but you wo nt know until you ve bought it and used it for a while it could be a dream  or it could be a nightmare it s a gamble  cars in general are a plague on mankind ,d008xbc,frugal,lifestyle,1455505166.0,Tripoteur,9.0,0.0,1,5101,0.0

451,452,scion is being discontinued by toyota  so you ll basically be buying the equivalent of a saturn  although probably more reliable   if you were going to buy new  i would get a honda fit or toyota yaris  because resale value will likely hold up better if you are financing  you will get a better interest rate on a new car vs a used one if you can not afford to finance the car for 36 months or less  than you can not afford the car do nt consider leasing because that s not frugal  for used  have you checked into a hyundai from the late 2000s to present  they are reliable  economical to run  and do nt carry the toyota tax make sure you get a reputable shop to check the vehicle before purchase during a  prepurchase inspection  or ppi avoid any luxury cars or european makes because they have high maintenance costs in the long term  most people with good used toyotas and hondas know what they have and will drive it  forever  there is a high demand for them on the used market and that s why they have such high resale value on the market buying a new honda fit or toyota yaris and keeping it for a very long time  15 years  is frugal in my opinion  provided that the rest of your finances are in good order ,d007fy3,frugal,lifestyle,1455502564.0,MemoryAccessRegister,1.0,0.0,1,1192,0.0

455,456,i am building a new home  12001500sqft   and i am not only interested in saving money during the construction phase  but during the lifetime of the home as well it seems to me that utility bills are the biggest place where money just gets sucked away for no good reason so  the idea of an  energy star  certified home is very appealing to me  however  the requirements for a home to be certified as  energy star  are very stringent  and it seems like many builders in my area do nt have a lot of experience with it  and i am also having a very difficult time finding floor plans that are already energy star certified not to mention  there are several versions of energy star  and none of the plans i have found even mention which version they adhere to  so  what i would really be interested in knowing  is could nt i just get the majority of the energy savings from just ensuring that a small handful of things were done right  such as the hvac  insulation  and windows  rather than going for the full specification  or is going for the actual certification going to end up saving me in the long run ,45sj7f,frugal,lifestyle,1455479033.0,Zarxrax,136.0,0.0,401,1976,0.0

569,570,no  i think you are seeing a lot of posts saying do nt buy a truck and make better decision on what type of car to buy etc i d like to say i agree with those statements that being said the reason we can give good advice is that most of us learned from bad choices  it is your money i suggest you do your research and if you want frugal advice it is that the choice you ve laid out are not necessarily the most frugal choices  if you want car advice rwhatcarshouldibuy ideally from the frugal point of view you want to buy a 23 year old car with 2040k miles that has been maintained  oil changes etc  keep it until it is in the 89 year range andor 90100k miles  this is the time that the purchased vehicle deprecates the least ie you own it for the least loss in value per year then buy another used car  and sell your old one  you should be looking for bout 4 months before you purchase but be willing to jump on a great deal if you need to it is   always   worth it to take a multithousand dollar prospect to a trusted mechanic for a checkout before buying legit sellers will work with you on getting it there  possibly paying for it or knocking the cost from the price  i personally would not buy a car that you need to work on to get running period to many things can come up in discovery as you fix that  one item  that needs fixing ,d02rmf4,frugal,lifestyle,1455678718.0,ruat_caelum,1.0,0.0,33,7890,0.0

1041,1042,i have some experience  and a couple of comments from experience  i volunteered with casas por cristo to help build a couple of the hundered or so houses they build each year in ciudad juarez  mexico each house is a 4day project and measured approx 15x20   and had a br  lr and k they are wired but not plumbed  those houses  just for comparision  were built on a concrete slab  day 1   on day 2 lumber arrived to complete the 2  x4  and 2  x6  wall and roof framing on day 3 the sheathing arrived and the roof and walls were sheathed and on day 4 the house was wired  donated ceiling fans and lighting installed  and windows and doors installed and exterior was roofed and fully painted  the materials were delivered on an asneeded schedule and installed so that nothing was stolen overnight  2 the intended occupants needed to have ownership of the land on which the house was built  so that no one could use force to muscle in on the property   typically the small plot of land  maybe providing 10  frontbackside lot  was donated and documented by a relative or a religeous group  3 the houses all had an agreement with the nearest neighbor that the new house could have a garden hose connection to supply water there were no drains or sewer connections  and most neighbors agreed to let the new neighbors use the bathroom  4 the city provided an electric service wire and meter casas por cristo provided the main service box and inside wiring  somehow you need to have assurances that no one will take your house away from you  in the usa  this level of construction would cost out at  15 per square foot for the slab  and  20 per square foot for the structure above it total  about  35 per square foot plus land cost  electrical hook up ,czzxm5w,frugal,lifestyle,1455484795.0,SyntheticOne,0.0,0.0,12,3385,0.0

1059,1060,you need to do some math to figure out your best course of action your total transportation expenses should never exceed 20  of your yearly earnings  and if you re wanting to be frugal about it  then it should be much lower let s use a yearly earning of 40k for this example  and we ll use the max 20   20  of 40k is  666month cost of car ownership items that are nt going to widely vary no matter what car you buy are gas  maintenancerepairs  and insurance lets say you drive 1k milesmonth  industry average   if the vehicle that you re going to buy gets 20mpg average then you ll use 50 gallonsmonth so  lets just round gas out to 100month because you re financing  you ll need comp and collision insurance so we ll estimate that at  150month maintenance costs  oil changes  tires  repairs  registration  inspection  etc  will be about 100month  but could be more if you buy an older vehicle we ll just stick with 100 because its close enough that means the max you have to finance the vehicle is  310month if your credit is decent you ll get about 5  interest rate financing that puts you at  19500 total to be financed your cost of ownership  insurance  gas  maintenance  over 5 years will be  21000 so over 5 years you ll spend right at 40k to drive this car you re going to buy lets say the car is 4 years old and has industry average miles when you buy it  48k miles over 5 years you ll have put another 60k on it now you have a car with 108k that you spent  40k on  you could put an extra  100month into repairs for your camry  drive that for 5 more years  and have spent  26k total  based on our ownership costs  and save the rest of the money we wo nt even consider the savings on the insurance by not having to have comp or collision  we ll use that as a buffer in case anything goes catastrophically wrong with the car or in our budgeting then use the 14k plus whatever else you saved to buy a  15k car for cash in 2021  if that s what you want to do  or you could use the money from selling your vehicle plus some of your current savings to buy a better vehicle than you have now for cash and continue banking the difference then just keep upgrading your vehicle every so often in the same manner  paying cash plus the value of your current vehicle  this is how you get ahead this is how you stay out of debt debtfree is the most frugal thing you can do do nt be a slave to your debt and your life will be richer and more fulfilling this is what being frugal is about ,d00lu2s,frugal,lifestyle,1455543094.0,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,1.0,0.0,3026,7538,0.0

15903,15904,i m getting ready to propose to my girlfriend in the next couple months so i ve started looking at diamond rings i know some of you are going to say buying an overpriced rock is not frugal but i want to get her a diamond and i know she wants one too plus these clarity enhanced diamonds are my way of being frugal  anyways  i started looking at them when i saw how expensive they were in stores any decent looking ring that i liked was 1015k and the ones in my price range of 57k looked tiny so i started digging online and on ebay there are a lot of sellers that have clarity enhanced rings that means the clarity was enhanced by one grade by either laser drilling blemishes or fracture filling i have read the pros and cons and to me  it looks like all the cons were written by big jewelry companies  wo nt hold value  and phrases like that i think diamonds are a stupid  investment  and i m not buying it in hopes of reselling it or whatever later this is an engagement ring for her the only other con i read is that the fillings do not handle heat as well as diamonds so i need to let the jeweler know before they do any work on it  there s a seller about 4 hours from me that has really nice rings that i like for 6k  2ct vs1 color h solitaire   similar ones in stores are well over 10k i still plan on going to look in person first but i will be buying with an american express card for my protection he has a 30 day no fee return policy and i plan on getting it checked out an appraised locally to make sure it s not a fake or lab grown diamond  so does anyone here have or ever seen a clarity enhanced diamond ring  what were your thoughts on it  i m still going to go look at them since wasting one day to save thousands of dollars is a good bet but just wanted to hear other s opinions    edit  i learned about lab grown diamonds from you guys and did some research on them you re right  they are the same in every way and wig less flaws i can get an even bigger rock and still cut my price in half brought it up with her and she agreed rd that it s stupid to get a  real  minned diamond and would rather i save money looks like she s a keeper and i i just saved a few grand thanks to you guys   ,45sq8a,frugal,lifestyle,1455481268.0,its_Danik,10.0,0.0,205,1225,0.0

16316,16317,hey buddy  i started working at your age too one thing you should do is watch your small checking account grow to like 500 or 1000 after your first grand then you will be so reluctant to just blow it away it feels really good to say that you have made 1000  and then it becomes easier to say  let s go for another 1000  then spend it on something after you get that next thousand it will be even harder to blow that away  so you will just slowly spend here and there  but never more than you make eventually  you will be at 5000 before you know it at that point  then you can decide whether you want to invest 80  of it in an index fund or a nice blue chip stock that you think will do better in the next 5 years since you are young you can afford to invest more of your money  more risk  because you probably wo nt need that   4000 immediately it could grow to  8000 in a few years or it could shrink to  2000  but its a risk you do nt want to miss at your age  tldr  reach your first 1000  then 20005000 choose to either invest it in stocks  or funds  i would do index   or into something like a car  enjoy maybe 10  of your paycheck on electronics  hobbies  or whatever you do to keep you happy ,czzaji1,frugal,lifestyle,1455428574.0,CalamariDude,5.0,0.0,59,18,0.0

33302,33303,hey buddy  i started working at your age too one thing you should do is watch your small checking account grow to like 500 or 1000 after your first grand then you will be so reluctant to just blow it away it feels really good to say that you have made 1000  and then it becomes easier to say  let s go for another 1000  then spend it on something after you get that next thousand it will be even harder to blow that away  so you will just slowly spend here and there  but never more than you make eventually  you will be at 5000 before you know it at that point  then you can decide whether you want to invest 80  of it in an index fund or a nice blue chip stock that you think will do better in the next 5 years since you are young you can afford to invest more of your money  more risk  because you probably wo nt need that   4000 immediately it could grow to  8000 in a few years or it could shrink to  2000  but its a risk you do nt want to miss at your age  tldr  reach your first 1000  then 20005000 choose to either invest it in stocks  or funds  i would do index   or into something like a car  enjoy maybe 10  of your paycheck on electronics  hobbies  or whatever you do to keep you happy ,czzaji1,frugal,lifestyle,1455428574.0,CalamariDude,7.0,0.0,59,18,0.0

34189,34190, i am assuming that  tupperware  is being used here as a generic term for  food storage supplies  and not  tupperware     i realise many people are terrified of plastics nowadays  but  every time you buy a tub of cottage cheese or whatever  it comes with a  free container  let it defrost for a bit if frozen  dump the contents into your microwave or stovetop container  heat you do not need to go out and buy anything special to put leftovers in  if it s to take lunch to work  thrift stores are good  they have a fair whack of  tupperware  tupperware  which is pretty durable stuff  interestingly  here in canada  the  no name   https  assetsshoploblawscaproducts20189239b1enfront20189239_front_a01png  containers are way more durable than any of the brand name semidisposable  ziplok  gladware  rubbermaid takealongs  etc  stuff the glad lids break easily  the ziplok people keep  improving  the design and leaving you with a bunch of old stuff that does nt fit the new lids etc  the rubbermaid does nt seal well but the no name is cheap and lasts through all sorts of abuses  ikea s also worth a look for food storage stuff  i have nothing good to say about glass the lids do nt last  the glass itself is too prone to breakage  it s too heavy  it takes up too much room in the freezer and is annoying to tote around there are sound reasons housewives were happy to buy plastic for these purposes as soon as plastic became an option ,d01qp79,frugal,lifestyle,1455615555.0,her_nibs,7.0,0.0,5364,62613,0.0
