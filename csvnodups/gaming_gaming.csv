919,920,so am i missing a inside joke  or is it just the joke that wedding rings normally have a emotional weight and value attached to them that you cant put in numbers and a good part of players just see it as a item they can sell later  a metaphor for todays society where most weddings are a financial move and not driven by emotions  that most relation ship that even start with emotions get ripped down to numbers of the vaule you share with the partner when you get a divorce after years and years of distrust  where one of the partners worked hours and hours after the regular work end to give the other partner the opportunity to life to its fullest because the partner thought thats the only thing the partner deserved  and after all the work and pain you went thought you to get greeted by distrust and growing hate  to see the remains of the hard work in shards of the broken object in the room after a heavy fight  to know that all these years you where wrong and all the partner wanted was you  that the kids that are a reminder to happier time are suffering under the fights and screaming  that the innocent loved ones are suffering under a simple misunderstanding  that they might even more suffer because they might think they are the problem  you think you would know better now that every day you walk thought the shards of lamps which mirror your former happy life every day you wake up on a mattress on the ground after the divorce took everything you had and now only dirt and shards are what is left over  every day you go past the ripped apart photos that painfully remind you of the the oregon roadtrip where your kids enjoyed the tourist traps in the stops every day you walk past the dead memories of a life you cant get back everyday you leave through the door you once carried your wife in off to work you go because its the only thing that is left from your former life what is left of your current life now you have way to much money  then you could ever think off because thats the only thing you do recently you found the ring you once nervously bought for the big day but now all the love is gone its a cash number now so you sell it because making money is the only goal you have now ,d02b57k,gaming,gaming,1455654448.0,Stefen_007,-9.0,0.0,1,5247,0.0

944,945,the thing is we got a full  functioning game at launch the game was a huge success financially more so than was originally planned they had decided early on how much dlc they wanted to make so they set a price point then at  30 now the want to expand the game farther than planned so raising the season pass is acceptable they are allowing us to decide if we want to go ahead and buy the season pass at the original price before they raise it i think that s fair with buying the season pass now we know we are getting the two small dlc plus the first big expansion and based on the price for those individually we get more than our moneys worth now they said there will be more so i do nt know what the fuss is about i m going to buy the season pass now because i know what i m getting and it sounds very reasonable to show us what we are getting to buy in early and get it much cheaper ,d02s6e7,gaming,gaming,1455679628.0,apheix,2.0,0.0,55,1799,0.0

1246,1247,hello there veteran ps2 player here this game is one of the only mmofps s i ve ever heard of and it is not pay 2 win at all everything that requires money is purely cosmetic and i have only ever spent 5 dollars on this game i have over 1500 hours in this game and since people seem to be interested i ll help some people understand this game if they want to get into it first off is optimization  most of the so called  pro players  or people with a kd over 2 basically will tell you to disable shadows in your ini folder you can look up a youtube video for this it is very easy to do they will also run on potato settings with everything either turned down or low as for mouse sens there are some people that say high sens is better or low sens it really does not matter i play with a high sensitivity for the mouse i use which is the proteus core g502 as long as you can hit your targets consistently it will be fine there are 3 factions the new conglomerate  nc   terran republic  tr   and the vanu sovereignty  vs   choosing one to mainly play depends a lot on what kind of guns you enjoy using the nc have guns with a lot of damage but a slow firerate the tr have guns with moderate to small damage with a fast firerate and the vs have guns with moderate damage  moderate firerate but have more range than both of the other factions the next thing is the learning curve this game has a massive learning curve that will be hard to get into on your own which is sadly how i learned the game but the best way to do it is to join an outfit which is the same thing as a guild its called an outfit because of the military style of the game it does not matter what outfit you join as long as they are active and supportive of your play style and attitude i would also suggest visiting the subreddit of each individual server as they will be more helpful than rplanetside to find each server subreddit go to rplanetside and on the sidebar in a red box labeled  subreddit  you will see a link called  community sitespages   click on that and scroll down until you see a title that says  server specific subreddits   depending on the server you play on choose your subreddit and you can either make a thread wanting to join an outfit or there will be a list of outfits somewhere on the siderbar i can tell you a bit from this gif so in the bottom left is the map and you can see it has an a on it which is the point some bases only have one and some have multiple below the map you can see the name of the base where it says  broken arch road   right next to that is the symbol for the faction called  new conglomerate  or nc as people to call it below that you have your certs  resources  and xp boosts respectively its hard for me to tell what faction the guy is playing in this gif since he is cloaked but he is using a cqc bolt action rifle and each faction only has one it could either be the tsar for the terran repbulic  tr  or the sasr for the new conglomerate  nc   the guy up on the ridge is from the faction the vanu sovereignty or the vs the vehicle squishing that guy is called a sunderer its used as a mobile spawnpoint and has 2 top guns this means you can drive it anywhere except near the points of enemy bases and press b and people from your faction can spawn right next to it ,d02je7r,gaming,gaming,1455665929.0,atmalec,19.0,0.0,0,0,

19520,19521,hello there veteran ps2 player here this game is one of the only mmofps s i ve ever heard of and it is not pay 2 win at all everything that requires money is purely cosmetic and i have only ever spent 5 dollars on this game i have over 1500 hours in this game and since people seem to be interested i ll help some people understand this game if they want to get into it first off is optimization  most of the so called  pro players  or people with a kd over 2 basically will tell you to disable shadows in your ini folder you can look up a youtube video for this it is very easy to do they will also run on potato settings with everything either turned down or low as for mouse sens there are some people that say high sens is better or low sens it really does not matter i play with a high sensitivity for the mouse i use which is the proteus core g502 as long as you can hit your targets consistently it will be fine there are 3 factions the new conglomerate  nc   terran republic  tr   and the vanu sovereignty  vs   choosing one to mainly play depends a lot on what kind of guns you enjoy using the nc have guns with a lot of damage but a slow firerate the tr have guns with moderate to small damage with a fast firerate and the vs have guns with moderate damage  moderate firerate but have more range than both of the other factions the next thing is the learning curve this game has a massive learning curve that will be hard to get into on your own which is sadly how i learned the game but the best way to do it is to join an outfit which is the same thing as a guild its called an outfit because of the military style of the game it does not matter what outfit you join as long as they are active and supportive of your play style and attitude i would also suggest visiting the subreddit of each individual server as they will be more helpful than rplanetside to find each server subreddit go to rplanetside and on the sidebar in a red box labeled  subreddit  you will see a link called  community sitespages   click on that and scroll down until you see a title that says  server specific subreddits   depending on the server you play on choose your subreddit and you can either make a thread wanting to join an outfit or there will be a list of outfits somewhere on the siderbar i can tell you a bit from this gif so in the bottom left is the map and you can see it has an a on it which is the point some bases only have one and some have multiple below the map you can see the name of the base where it says  broken arch road   right next to that is the symbol for the faction called  new conglomerate  or nc as people to call it below that you have your certs  resources  and xp boosts respectively its hard for me to tell what faction the guy is playing in this gif since he is cloaked but he is using a cqc bolt action rifle and each faction only has one it could either be the tsar for the terran repbulic  tr  or the sasr for the new conglomerate  nc   the guy up on the ridge is from the faction the vanu sovereignty or the vs the vehicle squishing that guy is called a sunderer its used as a mobile spawnpoint and has 2 top guns this means you can drive it anywhere except near the points of enemy bases and press b and people from your faction can spawn right next to it ,d02je7r,gaming,gaming,1455665929.0,atmalec,16.0,0.0,46,335,0.0

33810,33811,hello there veteran ps2 player here this game is one of the only mmofps s i ve ever heard of and it is not pay 2 win at all everything that requires money is purely cosmetic and i have only ever spent 5 dollars on this game i have over 1500 hours in this game and since people seem to be interested i ll help some people understand this game if they want to get into it first off is optimization  most of the so called  pro players  or people with a kd over 2 basically will tell you to disable shadows in your ini folder you can look up a youtube video for this it is very easy to do they will also run on potato settings with everything either turned down or low as for mouse sens there are some people that say high sens is better or low sens it really does not matter i play with a high sensitivity for the mouse i use which is the proteus core g502 as long as you can hit your targets consistently it will be fine there are 3 factions the new conglomerate  nc   terran republic  tr   and the vanu sovereignty  vs   choosing one to mainly play depends a lot on what kind of guns you enjoy using the nc have guns with a lot of damage but a slow firerate the tr have guns with moderate to small damage with a fast firerate and the vs have guns with moderate damage  moderate firerate but have more range than both of the other factions the next thing is the learning curve this game has a massive learning curve that will be hard to get into on your own which is sadly how i learned the game but the best way to do it is to join an outfit which is the same thing as a guild its called an outfit because of the military style of the game it does not matter what outfit you join as long as they are active and supportive of your play style and attitude i would also suggest visiting the subreddit of each individual server as they will be more helpful than rplanetside to find each server subreddit go to rplanetside and on the sidebar in a red box labeled  subreddit  you will see a link called  community sitespages   click on that and scroll down until you see a title that says  server specific subreddits   depending on the server you play on choose your subreddit and you can either make a thread wanting to join an outfit or there will be a list of outfits somewhere on the siderbar i can tell you a bit from this gif so in the bottom left is the map and you can see it has an a on it which is the point some bases only have one and some have multiple below the map you can see the name of the base where it says  broken arch road   right next to that is the symbol for the faction called  new conglomerate  or nc as people to call it below that you have your certs  resources  and xp boosts respectively its hard for me to tell what faction the guy is playing in this gif since he is cloaked but he is using a cqc bolt action rifle and each faction only has one it could either be the tsar for the terran repbulic  tr  or the sasr for the new conglomerate  nc   the guy up on the ridge is from the faction the vanu sovereignty or the vs the vehicle squishing that guy is called a sunderer its used as a mobile spawnpoint and has 2 top guns this means you can drive it anywhere except near the points of enemy bases and press b and people from your faction can spawn right next to it ,d02je7r,gaming,gaming,1455665929.0,atmalec,17.0,0.0,46,335,0.0

68402,68403,the original  1994  xcom did this the best each shot was one bullet  but you could do an autoshot  which fired three individual bullets  and each one had its own trajectory computed you could miss all three  hit one of three  hit all three  so in this respect it more accurately reflected the odds of hitting  what i hate seeing in xcom  2016  is when you miss with a veritable volley of fire  every single shot blowing up a wall 10 feet above your target  it s obvious that a random number generator picked another item as your target  that should nt be how it works  in the original xcom  it computed line of sighteverything was fair game for a hit in between you and your target  including other aliens  or your own squadmates sometimes it made sense to target an alien in the back of a group so that there s a chance of mowing down two in one turnand it was also an extreme risk to shoot over your squadmates something which xcom2 does nt take into account  the level of complexity in a game from 22 years agoa game which was a total size of 38  megabytes  blows my mind  i strongly suggest people try the original xcom if they never have i think it holds up pretty well for a game so old ,d019isj,gaming,gaming,1455580492.0,farmthis,31.0,0.0,15835,39275,0.0
