784,hi  i have worked in wildlife rehab and can likely shed some light on this topic for those who do nt know one of the most common problems rehab facilities face is the process of imprinting an animal onto humans  or a lesser version of that where the animal just thinks that all humans are providers of food imagine releasing an imprinted bear  the bear thinks that he belongs with humans and will go try to find other humans to hang out with or score food from this is how  nuisance animals  are made  and you better believe people will call anybody to get this big fucking bear off their property  around me it is usually the dnr and in most cases it is putting the bear down this is why you see rehabers wearing costumes or masks when working with wildlife to be released so that animal does nt know what the big thing with the food is here is an example of people working with cranes  https  media2wnycorgi1200627c80photologueimages4bop_mig_crane_costumejpg people are nt perfect and there is a cute affectionate fox to be taken care of  and it s easier than you might imagine to imprint an animal onto people  especially when said animal is very young what most likely happened is that the workers spent too much time trying to play or cuddle with the little guy ,d02m9lk,adviceanimals,humor,1455670436.0,Bringer_of_Bears,111.0,0.0,96,799,0.0

1798,the shitty reality  the majority of relationships i see are destructive based on need and insecurity rather than anything positive  and its not a young thing either a few years back an older family couple were given a big party for their 50 years of marriage and everyone was congratulating them  but the actual reality  he was an abusive drunk  and when he finally died  she got her life back but we crave this bullshit fairtytale  forever after   when we should be praising quality  not years are you good for each other  do you add to each others lives  are you just a homoenous blob  together so long that the idea of being alone puts so much fear into you that the idea has to be shut down  if so  get out and quickly go cold turkey for a year  face that wall and then start again but go for the positive pepople  the folk who show love daily  not in gesture bullshit like flowers or gifts  but their damn actions  day in  day out thats love  its the small things  but ultimately its about putting the other persons happiness first  and if you both do that  well you might stand a chance   anything else is a cancer which will eat your time and you wont get it back i grew up with some family friends  childhood sweethearts he was a cocky know it all type  but a nice guy when they hit their 40s she confessed she never loved him and left him for his best friend  who she had been having an affair with he changed  and within a few years he had a heart attack and is now a shadow of his former self  a recluse and lost his life pulled away from under him but again  every  aaaaewed  the chidlhood sweetheart line  subtly pressuring them to stay together  and she did and thats what we wanted  this security that childhood sweethear shit is real and we can get swept of our feet and live the happy ever after but its usually not like that  most of the time the euphoria felt is the inesecrity being temporaily filled by the validation of someone elses love and thats hard to let go of  as when things turn sour  you have to have that validation taken away  get it for yourself first  then take that into your future and see what happens  ,d01l82u,adviceanimals,humor,1455599649.0,Craig_Hedge,17.0,0.0,4734,1942,0.0
