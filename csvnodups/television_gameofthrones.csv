148,149,i posted this theory in the teaser thread  but i wanted to hear everyone s thoughts on it excuse me for my shit writing  i ve been a firm believer that we will all or a strong majority of the characters die by the end of the story  per the ragnarok theory     i feel that the newly released teaser is a future vision by bran   i do nt think that all of these characters will necessarily die in the next season or book  but i think they will die before the conclusion of the story here is my reasoning  1 bran can have visions of the past  present  and future 2 the weirwood network is a catalyst for visions  and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be weirwood 3 looking at past season s teasers  i noticed that the show runners use clips of literal things that have occurred  are occurring  or will occur  they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting this teaser to be ,45ujah,gameofthrones,television,1455506327.0,glabuz11,0.0,0.0,507,453,0.0

151,152,my personal view is that he is aware that he is a bastard it s pretty much thought throughout the seven kingdoms that he is but people fear saying it for obvious reasons it s the rumor everyone suspects but can not support because you will end up being killed like ned stark and there is really only circumstantial evidence  joffrey clings to his lannister heritage because his father never really loved him his mother always doted on him in addition he is at war with his  uncle  who is a baratheon he only uses the baratheon title as it suits his legacy he only invokes robert when trying to verbally hurt tywin his  legitimacy  is a relationship of convenience so he can maintain power he knows deep down what he is even if he ca nt or would nt prove it  i ca nt recall exactly but is nt there a scene where joffrey mentions  rumors  about his mother and  uncle  jaime also myrcella admits she s always known jaime is her father i know it s a different character but it does nt take much to make the leap tommen  i believe  is just naive and oblivious ,czzoqbt,gameofthrones,television,1455469642.0,Ravager135,10.0,0.0,1,4055,0.0

166,167,here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit ,d00kqnl,gameofthrones,television,1455539761.0,athze2,13.0,0.0,1,791,0.0

______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

275,276,so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies ,45l30b,gameofthrones,television,1455379387.0,stos313,128.0,0.0,77,798,0.0
276,277,there could be a certain amount of fuck it just slow them down  going into the headshots in the books  when mormont sends thorne south to king s landing with the dead wight s hand in a jar  he mentions this in the show too   the hand is still alive  and moving for most of thorne s journey by the time he gets to king s landing it s just a dead hand  but when he left castle black  it was solid proof that magic was back in play  anyway what that means  as far as the rules go  is that the brain is nt really in play it s likely some sort of rangebased magic  you never see big hordes of undead moving without white walkers nearby the only way to stop the wights is to stop the walkers ,czylfi8,gameofthrones,television,1455383279.0,sielingfan,37.0,0.0,9108,66632,0.0
277,278,white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely decomposes  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them ,czym1ca,gameofthrones,television,1455384334.0,MakingTheEight,32.0,0.0,55,1365,0.0
278,279,it s likely that the first wights were cushioning the fall for the ones that fell on them  which would mean less damage for them the fact is  the white walkers have wights to spare  and they seem perfectly happy with sacrificing a few if it means they can get more  it seems that while headshots can work  you have to completely destroy the head  and even then  we ve seen that the limps can remain active  plus  you have to remember  these wights do seem to degrade  so the skeletons are just older  while the fresher wights are more human looking and it seems like for the resurrection to work  the white walkers must be close by we saw the night s king do it with very little effort ,czyjsy5,gameofthrones,television,1455380412.0,Rosebunse,12.0,0.0,40,111531,0.0

285,286,white walkersothers are definitely vulnerable to valyrian steel and obsidian in hardhome their natural cold seemed to diminish the effects of nearby fire but i suspect that a lot of projectile fire would do the trick people burn the dead bodies to prevent them returning as wights  which are the zombie like creatures that are killed only by fire or severe dismemberment,czzead1,gameofthrones,television,1455439110.0,markusalkemus66,1.0,0.0,1039,5494,0.0
286,287,not many rules understood it was discovered by sam that dragon glass kills ww  and dragon class is a result of volcanoes  another name for it obsidian jon was the only who discovered that valerian steel works too  it s knowledge is lost as well but everyone s got an itch that fire or dragons or volcanoes are involved  grrm says he relates valerian steel to damascus steel in real life and that it s knowledge was lost as well among other similarities  minus the magic offcourse  as for wights  aka your zombies  p they are stopped via chopping them into pieces or by fire the ww in hardhome that jon fought extinguished the fire before entering into the big tent  so i doubt fire works on them and i think it was mentioned in many sources it does nt work  except dragon s fire  that should work on both ww and wights as for the headshots  well  i guess they are just missing their headseyes so they are slowed as we saw in bran s battle with the wights  they do nt die or stop completely if you chop off their arms or heads  the two methods are burning or chopping them into many bits  slow them down enough they are nt a threat i guess ,czzg7wd,gameofthrones,television,1455447459.0,spooket,1.0,0.0,1,322,0.0

460,461,i think it would bring in the world from the show and books beautifully imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent  unless if you have dragon glass or valerian steal of course   all of westeros would of course be included up from the  haunted forest  to  dorn  and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it s entirety  the story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks  the game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of eddard stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen for example if you picked john snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle  benjen stark  has gone missing and your given a mission to try and find out what has happened if you pick sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to castle black of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from  some characters should not be playable at all such as arya stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as sandor and brienne should be playable  important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you become wealthy and powerful enough  i could imagine myself picking a character such as john snow or petyr baelish  haha  and riding one of khaleesi s dragons taking out white walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game  they would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil  what do you all think ,45xzhg,gameofthrones,television,1455562126.0,ThunderousBlade,2.0,0.0,1034,259,0.0

481,482,honestly  i do not think the formula that bethesda developed during their last few games would lend itself very well to the asoiaf universe there are three main points in skyrim and fallout 4 that imo would make for a very bad translation into westeros 1 the player always has total freedom to do whatever he wants  no part of the world advances without player input  you can always drop whatever you were doing and go to a totally different place and nobody will mind at all  2 the player is everywhere recognized as  the hero  and every faction you join gives you an important position at the very beginning  3 very little dialogue  that especially in fallout 4 was more or less just an excuse for an  accept mission  screen  i understand that some people might like the notion of playing as peter baelish  who is married to daenerys  can summon dragons  is eddard stark s best friend  lord commander of the night s watch  prince of dorne  leader of the faceless men and hand of the king   all at the same time   or join the night s watch as a nameless recruit  say your vows  then just walk away to the south in order to save eddard stark from execution  next go to tywin lannister in casterly rock  kill a few bandits for him and be named general of his armies  i can see the appeal in such a total sandbox game for some people  but that would be a waste of a universe that heavily builds on its existing story  and if the player is in addition to that also able to influence the outcome of all important events  it would either be extremely expensive to create  write and record a script for the red wedding if any of the characters present might be dead or be in another place  if other characters might be present depending on what the player had done  if the player himself would interfer  how the world would react if the player killed everyone present  if the player had already destroyed the world with dragonfire prior to doing that quest   or  in order to save those costs  the illusion of freedom would only be a lie  eg robb stark would always be present at the red wedding  no matter what the player might do to stop him from going   or if the player performed actions that would change history  it would just correct itself  you can save commander mormont from being betrayed  but he will just be killed by a white walker moments later so jon can become lord commander   at which point  why even do it then  a sandbox game with nameless characters during another time period of anarchy where the paths of the main players are not as clearly defined  like the blackfyre rebellion  might work  but if it is set during the events of the bookshow  i can not see how it would be anything more than tons and tons of fanfiction  with very little of what actually makes asoiaf what it is ,d012ljj,gameofthrones,television,1455569974.0,Sorstalas,4.0,0.0,1,795,0.0

611,612,i think ramsay s introduction in the books is so much better than in the show  in the books  before theon captures winterfell  bran hears word of ramsay snow taking over the castle of a woman whose husband had recently died and who had no male heirs he forces this woman to marry her and locks her in a tower bran sends a group of men to capture ramsay and his men when the group returns  they return with a boy named reek  ramsay s servant according to them  they killed ramsay and his men and were able to take reek prisoner so they lock him in the prison in winterfell  later  after theon takes winterfell  he frees this reek  and it is actually this reek  who suggests that theon kill the two miller s boys and pass them off as bran and rickon after winterfell is surrounded  reek  convinces theon to let him go to the dreadfort with a sack of money  to return with reinforcements theon agrees when reek  returns  however  he slaughters the northmen surrounding winterfell and reveals himself to have been ramsay all along he switched clothes with the real reek  who was killed in his place ramsay and his men then sack winterfell and ramsay takes theon as his personal prisoner and turns him into the new reek ,d01gxbd,gameofthrones,television,1455592223.0,HolyPhlebotinum,23.0,0.0,1,2057,0.0

631,632,are nt they all kind of destroyed right now  especially in the show  stark  ned dead  his father rodrick too  his sister lyanna too  his brother brandon too  his brother benjen is gone  his wife catelyn is dead  his son robb the king in the north is dead  along with his wife talisa and his child and even his wolf  5 children remain but they re all believed dead except for sansa who is well sansa lannister for the south and sansa bolton for the north  they may get a proper comeback though  it must be season 6 main plot right now  boltons rule  tully  catelyn is dead  her father too  so as far as i know we have edmure as a hostage poor brynden tully will most certainly face a siege by the freys for now  the riverlands are rulled by the freys the boltonsfreys alliance really replaced the starktully one  arryn  well  jon arryn is dead and lysa is dead  so there is robin  a retarded child basically the power of the vale belongs to littlefinger now  baratheon  renly is dead stannis is dead with his family and allies  robert s name is carried by the current king  tommen baratheon who is in fact a lannister incestuous son as more and more people know about the incest  baratheon name is basically gone keep rowing gendry  tyrell  the brother and the sister  queen  are in jail  i think loras will die this season as well as mace and possibly grandma olenna loras  brothers are nt even mentionned in the show id say their credibility is gone same as lannisters  their fight brought them down together  martells  well  they may be in the best position right now  they managed to stay out of the conflict until season 4 so the majority of their power is still there but despite prince doran patience they lately took part in the war too with quentin dead  not even in the show  and aryanne not existing in the show  they may end just like the others  lannister  tywin is dead he was the lannisters  then  what do we have  3 children 1 killed his father  and officialy his nephewking  and is now on the run  the two other are a mad queen who just lost what she had  political power   and un onehanded kingslayer  who ca nt inherit lands nor marry  who by the way fucked the said mad queen and got 3 incestuous bastards the first was mad and is dead  the second was beautiful and is dead  and the third one has the will of a ronflex in a kfc out of chickens  they re being destroyed allong with their tyrell rivals by the high sparrow amp  co   amp  co  including cousin lancel  who ca nt inherit and fucked the queen too poor kevan despite being the last  respectable and capable  lannister has no heir  and will probably die in the show like in the books im having a hard time listing all the reasons this family is fucked still  they re my favorite family and i m sad  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  if i were some throne player  i d ask myself if i d really want to get those 7 shitdoms right now  do you think cousins of cousins and forgotten bastards can carry the greatest names or do you think the  7 kingdoms  will belong to other families ,463k6l,gameofthrones,television,1455644208.0,Azorent,54.0,0.0,0,0,

685,686,personally  i think they shot themselves in the foot when they staged jon s  death  as the season finale by doing that  they condemned themselves to a year of fans not wondering  if  jon snow would return  but  when  he would return  which makes the cliffhanger an empty threat what s done is done  though  if they held off on a jon snow reveal  his absence at least sinks in a bit and the other storylines are allowed to breathe however  they run the risk of fans saying  when will they hurry up and bring jon snow back  nothing else in the show seems important right now  unfortunately  the show is going to have to do a lot of setup again  because all the storylines reached a climax together and will each need resetting  dany meeting the dothraki  the new dynamic in king s landing  sam in oldtown  bran s return  sansa and theon sorting out their shit   on the other hand  an early jon snow revival would give the season an early rush of momentum  which would counteract the dullness of setting up the other storylines  tl  dr  it s a catch22 whether he comes back sooner or later ,d01poii,gameofthrones,television,1455611601.0,sletrab07,7.0,0.0,1,293,0.0

791,792,very little is known about the white walkers  or others  as they are called in the books   according to westerosi lore  they last invaded around 8000 years ago during the long night  although the accuracy of this is disputed because it predates written history by several thousand years we know that they come from the very far north  but when and how they originated is unknown  as for stopping them  sam killed one with a dagger made of dragonglass aka obsidian valyrian steel works in the show  but has nt been tested in the books the books mention something called dragonsteel which has been used to stop them  although it is not confirmed whether this is valyrian steel since valyria was nt around 8000 years ago and dragons were nt introduced to westeros until very recently  either the accepted timeline is wrong  there was some white walker activity after the long night  or the first men acquired protovalyrian steel from another source we also know of the myth of the last hero  who ended the long night using a sword forged with a blood sacrifice this could have been the first dragonsteel sword or it could have been a unique magical occurrence valyrian steel does require blood sacrifices and fire magic  obsidian shows that firebased weapons are super effective   which would make it an ideal weapon for killing the white walkers but because we know so little about the long night  it is nt clear whether the last hero was just a guy with a really awesome sword made of technology yet to be discovered  or whether he had other abilities and his sword was mainly a symbol of his magic power ,d01h932,gameofthrones,television,1455592740.0,SanguisFluens,2.0,0.0,0,0,

1021,1022,dragon glass and valerian steel are probably the same thing  at least it s been speculated for a long time that they are and there s enough evidence to assume for now that they are  i do nt think headshots have ever been shown to kill them  just fire and dragon glassvalerian steel there s a theory that valerian steel is forged with dragon fire i think the wildlings aiming for headshots are just doing so out of desperation there s too many for them to actually win so they re just lashing out with what they have available that said  we ve never seen a headless white walker which suggests they ca nt be reanimated it s likely that the magic the others use is similar to those of the red priests and if you remember  when arya asked if they could reanimate someone without a head  poor baby t  t   thoros responsed that they could nt we do nt really know enough to draw a conclusion really i m inclined to believe that if the headsskulls are nt completely destroyed the wights could continue to fight hence why the dead in the north and beyond the wall are burnt and not simply beheaded but i think if they were to just be beheaded then they would nt come back  side note  does anyone else hope that when the others inevitably make it down to winterfell  we ll see white walker brandon  lyanna and rickard    as far as does reanimation only occur during winter  it s the ww who reanimate people  apart from the red priests but that s for another conversation   and it s always winter when they appear  although it s not clear if they create winter and bring it with them or if winter spreads and they follow if it s the former  i d assume that if they were not stopped before reaching dorne  then yes they could also spread to esso  the summer isles and sothoryos ,czzkh1n,gameofthrones,television,1455461397.0,Ash3070,1.0,0.0,3417,1934,1.0

1481,1482,i d love it if it began toward what most presume is the end of the song of ice and fire main storyline  assuming  and this is purely speculation and assumption because we re simply not far enough in the story to know for sure  that the white walkers do indeed get past the wall and begin to spread south across westeros  imagine if that was like the last act  of the main quest  it d be great if you made your own house  maybe there was a few locations you could choose to place your hold  spots in the north  midland and south of westeros  and you basically can build it from the ground up  eventually becoming a house of decent stature and wealth but not a great noble house as to not conflict too much with existing lore obviously it d not really be canon anyway due to freedom of player choice but still  then  on top of that  imagine that you could either play the main quest focusing on gaining political power for your house  the benefit of which would be better wealth and upgrade choices for yourself  your hold  or alternatively play less for political power and more for things like siding with northern houses to uproot the boltons  or even straight up spreading the word of impending white walker doom doing it this way might make your battle against the white walkers in the last act more viable  also  character creation is a must  obviously  i dunno just  stuff  ,d015m9i,gameofthrones,television,1455574421.0,Doylio,2.0,0.0,0,0,

13078,13079,people like maegary  sansa  littlefinger etc excels at politics and manipulation  but white walkers are pretty much a force of nature who do nt give a crap about anything other than obliteration of man  what we seen so far   there will be little politics involved except a treaty based on mutual destruction  and jon snow can provide that since he has delt similar things before so what use would be for these characters  other than act as civilians and sit the entire thing out  ,45lf45,gameofthrones,television,1455382753.0,sephelutis,78.0,0.0,1,19,0.0

13391,13392, theory   warning  i am using references from both the show and the book currently  i am reading book one  have watched the entire series  i noticed some recurring dreams about the crypts between the stark family  in the show  bran has a dream that eddard is in the crypts  so he visits them once he awakens rickon and shaggydog are down there as well and says that he also had a dream about their father  without bran ever mentioning his dream to him  in the books  jon tells sam about a dream he has of the crypts and how he does nt want to go to them  but he knows he has to as i have nt gotten very far into the books  i do nt know if it ever mentions arya or sansa having a dream about them  but i believe i read somewhere  or even watched it on the show  that eddard has a dream about the crypts as well  honestly  i ca nt put together a crazy theory as to why that s happening  but i feel that it s very important the crypts are important i read somewhere about a theory of the white walkers taking winterfell because the crypts are magic  or something like that it was much more majestically worded  but i have a pretty bad memory  and i ve learned the consequences as to what happens when you put all of your eggs in one basket  so i wo nt say that it has to be true  just wondering if any of you guys have some cool theories  or just simple reasons  to explain this ,45ni8z,gameofthrones,television,1455408047.0,persici,97.0,0.0,1,40,0.0
13393,13394,i believe that winterfell is named so because this is where  winter fell   as in where the ww were defeated and a pact was signed  when bran the builder raised the wall  with the intent of keeping out the ww  he probably knew that the ww would attack again so he had the crypts built and started the tradition of burying starks down there  and here s the other thing starks are buried  not burned and they are buried with their swords  which brings us to my theory  when the ww take winterfell  every dead stark will rise  not as a wight  but something like lsh they ll remember who they were  take their swords and fight the hordes ,czz8g9y,gameofthrones,television,1455424136.0,Ali_Safdari,77.0,0.0,163,1191,0.0
13394,13395,some speculate that winterfell serves as a prison it has hot springs so it has volcanic activity  its walls are also heated so essentially if some being of ice were to be trapped in the crypts it would be near impossible to escape  i also believe that hodor saw something down there  damaging his mind with the name of the great other being hodor the only reason to trap such a being and not kill it would be if killing is not possible if the great other is trapped down there that could also explain the unequal seasons it would also explain why the starks are the kings of winter  the physical manifestation of winter is literally their prisoner  would be a nice twist also explains what the white walkers intend to do south of the wall ,czzgj7s,gameofthrones,television,1455448891.0,Phalanx300,15.0,0.0,941,19330,0.0

13558,13559,i think it would bring in the world from the show and books beautifully imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent  unless if you have dragon glass or valerian steal of course   all of westeros would of course be included up from the  haunted forest  to  dorn  and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it s entirety  the story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks  the game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of eddard stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen for example if you picked john snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle  benjen stark  has gone missing and your given a mission to try and find out what has happened if you pick sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to castle black of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from  some characters should not be playable at all such as arya stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as sandor and brienne should be playable  important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you become wealthy and powerful enough  i could imagine myself picking a character such as john snow or petyr baelish  haha  and riding one of khaleesi s dragons taking out white walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game  they would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil  what do you all think ,45xzhg,gameofthrones,television,1455562126.0,ThunderousBlade,3.0,0.0,1034,259,0.0

13573,13574,so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies ,45l30b,gameofthrones,television,1455379387.0,stos313,127.0,0.0,77,798,0.0

13576,13577,white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely decomposes  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them ,czym1ca,gameofthrones,television,1455384334.0,MakingTheEight,33.0,0.0,55,1365,0.0

themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

13884,13885,here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit ,d00kqnl,gameofthrones,television,1455539761.0,athze2,11.0,0.0,1,791,0.0

18749,18750,honestly  i do not think the formula that bethesda developed during their last few games would lend itself very well to the asoiaf universe there are three main points in skyrim and fallout 4 that imo would make for a very bad translation into westeros 1 the player always has total freedom to do whatever he wants  no part of the world advances without player input  you can always drop whatever you were doing and go to a totally different place and nobody will mind at all  2 the player is everywhere recognized as  the hero  and every faction you join gives you an important position at the very beginning  3 very little dialogue  that especially in fallout 4 was more or less just an excuse for an  accept mission  screen  i understand that some people might like the notion of playing as peter baelish  who is married to daenerys  can summon dragons  is eddard stark s best friend  lord commander of the night s watch  prince of dorne  leader of the faceless men and hand of the king   all at the same time   or join the night s watch as a nameless recruit  say your vows  then just walk away to the south in order to save eddard stark from execution  next go to tywin lannister in casterly rock  kill a few bandits for him and be named general of his armies  i can see the appeal in such a total sandbox game for some people  but that would be a waste of a universe that heavily builds on its existing story  and if the player is in addition to that also able to influence the outcome of all important events  it would either be extremely expensive to create  write and record a script for the red wedding if any of the characters present might be dead or be in another place  if other characters might be present depending on what the player had done  if the player himself would interfer  how the world would react if the player killed everyone present  if the player had already destroyed the world with dragonfire prior to doing that quest   or  in order to save those costs  the illusion of freedom would only be a lie  eg robb stark would always be present at the red wedding  no matter what the player might do to stop him from going   or if the player performed actions that would change history  it would just correct itself  you can save commander mormont from being betrayed  but he will just be killed by a white walker moments later so jon can become lord commander   at which point  why even do it then  a sandbox game with nameless characters during another time period of anarchy where the paths of the main players are not as clearly defined  like the blackfyre rebellion  might work  but if it is set during the events of the bookshow  i can not see how it would be anything more than tons and tons of fanfiction  with very little of what actually makes asoiaf what it is ,d012ljj,gameofthrones,television,1455569974.0,Sorstalas,3.0,0.0,1,795,0.0

19183,19184,so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies ,45l30b,gameofthrones,television,1455379387.0,stos313,126.0,0.0,77,798,0.0

19747,19748,with today s release of a new teaser for season 6  i thought it might be interesting to take a deeper look into what is actually shown perhaps we could identify a pattern or some other

themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

19749,19750,here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit ,d00kqnl,gameofthrones,television,1455539761.0,athze2,12.0,0.0,1,791,0.0

26264,26265,i think it would bring in the world from the show and books beautifully imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent  unless if you have dragon glass or valerian steal of course   all of westeros would of course be included up from the  haunted forest  to  dorn  and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it s entirety  the story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks  the game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of eddard stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen for example if you picked john snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle  benjen stark  has gone missing and your given a mission to try and find out what has happened if you pick sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to castle black of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from  some characters should not be playable at all such as arya stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as sandor and brienne should be playable  important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you become wealthy and powerful enough  i could imagine myself picking a character such as john snow or petyr baelish  haha  and riding one of khaleesi s dragons taking out white walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game  they would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil  what do you all think ,45xzhg,gameofthrones,television,1455562126.0,ThunderousBlade,4.0,0.0,1034,259,0.0

27883,27884,white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely decomposes  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them ,czym1ca,gameofthrones,television,1455384334.0,MakingTheEight,29.0,0.0,55,1365,0.0

themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things

43104,43105,honestly  i do not think the formula that bethesda developed during their last few games would lend itself very well to the asoiaf universe there are three main points in skyrim and fallout 4 that imo would make for a very bad translation into westeros 1 the player always has total freedom to do whatever he wants  no part of the world advances without player input  you can always drop whatever you were doing and go to a totally different place and nobody will mind at all  2 the player is everywhere recognized as  the hero  and every faction you join gives you an important position at the very beginning  3 very little dialogue  that especially in fallout 4 was more or less just an excuse for an  accept mission  screen  i understand that some people might like the notion of playing as peter baelish  who is married to daenerys  can summon dragons  is eddard stark s best friend  lord commander of the night s watch  prince of dorne  leader of the faceless men and hand of the king   all at the same time   or join the night s watch as a nameless recruit  say your vows  then just walk away to the south in order to save eddard stark from execution  next go to tywin lannister in casterly rock  kill a few bandits for him and be named general of his armies  i can see the appeal in such a total sandbox game for some people  but that would be a waste of a universe that heavily builds on its existing story  and if the player is in addition to that also able to influence the outcome of all important events  it would either be extremely expensive to create  write and record a script for the red wedding if any of the characters present might be dead or be in another place  if other characters might be present depending on what the player had done  if the player himself would interfer  how the world would react if the player killed everyone present  if the player had already destroyed the world with dragonfire prior to doing that quest   or  in order to save those costs  the illusion of freedom would only be a lie  eg robb stark would always be present at the red wedding  no matter what the player might do to stop him from going   or if the player performed actions that would change history  it would just correct itself  you can save commander mormont from being betrayed  but he will just be killed by a white walker moments later so jon can become lord commander   at which point  why even do it then  a sandbox game with nameless characters during another time period of anarchy where the paths of the main players are not as clearly defined  like the blackfyre rebellion  might work  but if it is set during the events of the bookshow  i can not see how it would be anything more than tons and tons of fanfiction  with very little of what actually makes asoiaf what it is ,d012ljj,gameofthrones,television,1455569974.0,Sorstalas,5.0,0.0,1,795,0.0
