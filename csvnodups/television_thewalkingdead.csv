20,albeit a 2 hour episode instead of one from top to bottom  it was probably one of the best in the entire series so far in my opinion it covered the broad spectrum of emotions and ended on a semitriumphant note  i told myself for the longest time that i would be fine if everyone died except for rick and carl but after tonight i find myself caring about everyone in rick s new family i know going forward that some or most of them wo nt make it to the series end so this episode would be a perfect ending for me ,460z5u,thewalkingdead,television,1455599880.0,Vivalaredsox,83.0,0.0,1136,12178,0.0

55,i think the michonne character will have a surprising development but i see her sooner as rick s new love interest than as a surprising death think about it andrea is dead maggie has glenn and michonne has been like a mother to carl my guess is that morgan will be killed off the show focusses on his refusal to kill what better way to sacrifice yourself by offering your life  still keep your convictions and teach rick  and maybe carol  a lesson about not having to kill everything,d02g5fc,thewalkingdead,television,1455661128.0,Oriopax,1.0,0.0,548,221,0.0
56,michonne has been through so much everyone has  i get that  it s the zombie apocalypse and everyone s life has turned to shit but michonne her story really hits hard for me  though i ca nt particularly 100  relate to it  even there s just something so numbing about it she s lost everyone she held dear her boyfriend  best friend  her son and making her boyfriend and best friend into zombie slaves  i always thought that was so badass  but really  it was a thin layer she held onto so she did nt have to completely let go a place of denial when they were  re  killed  she lost it all  i know some others have lost everything  too carol  she lost her husband  though to be honest  good riddance  and her daughter that must hurt  so  bad she s hardened up and i honestly do nt hold that against her  because it s a rational way to react in a world as cold as the one she s living in  it s dangerous to be kind and have an open heart  maggie maggie lost nearly her entire family at the farm  then her dad at the prison and her sister at the hospital i love maggie to death  and the only thing that makes me feel less like she s lost everything  but please stop showing her crying oh my god it hurts my heart  is that she has glenn and you know  we re all speculating that he ll be dead soon  and if he does  should i say when   i m kinda expecting it but i know i ll still be shocked  then she ll have lost everything  ish  depending on where they go with the baby and all   there are other characters but i do nt want to make this longer than it already is michonne is a beautiful  strong character with a tragic past and we ve seen her open up a bit with carl and rick  and some of the others   which has been heartwarming and has given us a way to see more of who she is and how sweet her personality can be despite the hardships she s faced  and if she does die  oh my god i   will   cry it s something we are nt expecting because she s done so well for herself and others the whole time it truly would shock us all to the core  and that s a shock i do nt want to take ,d02r5zs,thewalkingdead,television,1455677978.0,dinolesbo,2.0,0.0,444,416,0.0

92,well that was brutal  great episode with some very good action sequences  loved the montage of characters just swinging their weapons at the screen  but i must say that carl living is another cliche  so we get 3 simultaneous deaths of the anderson family getting eaten alive  and one amazingly satisfying stabbing  and yet conveniently carl lives after receiving a bullet to the eye  have a word with yourselves writers  i m not saying it s impossible or implausible because it is nt but why save all of the major characters in this crazy zombieriddled episode  have some balls it s ironic that morgan is getting more annoying and gabriel is getting more tolerable  bad writing  or is morgan just a complete wank stain   even after his amazing centricepisode  this should have been the midseason finale because the one we got was terrible  but i know why it was nt because there was nt a cliffhanger to lead us into the rest of the season  i still do nt understand why so many people hate rick though  he is bad ass  and actually has evolved over the years 810  carl living brought it down ,d016vxg,thewalkingdead,television,1455576347.0,MarkWatson12,1.0,0.0,1,25,0.0

249,no if he had actually changed he would nt have forced denise to try and run for the wall when she was attacked he did nt help to be a nice person he only went back to save her because he needed her  she dies and he dies of his infection the only decent thing he ever does is after he s stabbed  bitten  and shot in the chest that was nt change that was  i m dead anyways ,d01kk7y,thewalkingdead,television,1455598333.0,slowsupra,17.0,0.0,394,49754,0.0
250,yes morgan changed him he could have made it out on his own but wants to bring denise he engages with her on a human level  you do nt have to scared  is nt something an ordinary wolf says to people compare the way he spoke to morgan and denise earlier  i m going to kill you i m going back o take all your shit you re already dead  amp  etc it s clear they intended to convey that morgan s  and eastmans  methods actually can work ,d01ktdp,thewalkingdead,television,1455598833.0,fatfrost,9.0,0.0,40,13510,0.0

270,was your performance supposed to act as a sort of red herring for negan  i think that most fans of the comic knew that you would nt end up as negan  especially with all of the buzz about jeffrey dean morgan  but a lot of fans of the show took to the internet asking  is that him    in my opinion  the fact that you delivered such a terrifying performance only to be immediately killed added significant weight to the horror of the plot negan is not going to be happy that such powerful individual was taken from him ,d02c94q,thewalkingdead,television,1455655883.0,JonWesHarding,3.0,0.0,1,3404,0.0

374,i mean he was right about the wolf dude he could have left denise to die when he s running to the tower to escape also he chose to take out some zombies to give her the chance to escape  even after being shot twice by carol i feel like that s a big plot point from this last episode i have nt seen much discussion about ,462w55,thewalkingdead,television,1455636279.0,Howdy15,204.0,0.0,20,37,0.0

380,nobody is right or wrong because there is a huge grey area here it lands on a series of ifs and buts like denise would nt have even been outside in the walker herd if wolf did nt take her out there at gun point then again she may have died if he did nt come back for her  intentions or not although he did save denise at the end by tackling a walker while dying  morgan took a huge fuckin  risk by keeping someone who openly threatened to murder his group multiple times carol fucked up too because she could see them running together  not at gun point anymore  and she shot him anyways because thats what she thought had to be done no matter what she only realized after that maybe she did nt have to in that moment so this situation  even though caused by morgan  lands on both of them and i hope they go more in depth to the consequences of what happened ,d025p62,thewalkingdead,television,1455647146.0,motleycruejew,2.0,0.0,10478,4969,0.0

389,in the world of the walking dead people have finally realized that they need walls to keep out the dead and other enemies just like centuries ago however  they are still forgetting one critical component a citadelkeep  castles  and other walled fortresses would always have a citadel for people to fall back if the outer walls were ever breached given the latest incident in alexandria why did the powers that be ever build a citadel for everyone to fall back if the walls were ever compromised ,463yho,thewalkingdead,television,1455649004.0,CCV21,37.0,0.0,1473,5348,0.0

391,not even the wolf understands his own motives he s confused  the ladder was clear i could have left but i came back for you   not verbatim   when you re faced with fight or flight  it s pure instinct but the motive is still a mystery i thought the wolf was going to use denise as bait to draw the walkers away but then he went back for her did he save her because he changed  or did he save her to use her later  she s proven herself to help with medical situations  did he save her because he wanted to turn her into a wolf  if he really did have a change of heart  why was he still running  he could have gone back to morgan and said  ok  i ve changed  and morgan would have welcomed him  we ll never know his true intentions but we also can look at this as the intense struggle every character has on this show why do they do the things they do  some intentions may seem obvious but there are alternate motivators behind the scenes too the end of the world brings out the best and worst out of our dearly beloved characters ,d02b6t2,thewalkingdead,television,1455654505.0,diiskoo,1.0,0.0,1,11168,0.0

576,i feel he was right just not anymore  after witnessing how crazy people have become it s past that point now that he has witnessed it in fullscale his philosophy was one of the last remnants of humanity before the outbreak which is a whole book in itself if we were to talk about it i mean it s not that easy to choose to kill someone  or is it  and i think that s his personal grudge against carol back then  and how he reacted about rick changing  how easy it was for them to just kill ,d0285t1,thewalkingdead,television,1455650469.0,VS0P,1.0,0.0,1,139,0.0

578,i do nt believe morgan was right in letting the wolf live remember  he could have killed the wolf multiple times  starting with when the wolf and his buddy confronted morgan at his camp  prior to saving daryl and aaron and getting to alexandria but he let both wolves live  had he finished them  we might have not seen the wolves drive the truck into the wall at alexandria causing all this chaos that ensued thereafter the migrating of walkers from the quarry may have gone according to plan  with no horn to attract them  as much as i love carol  i do nt agree with her methods all the time there needs to be compromise between her view and morgan s to survive in this world but it makes me upset to think that morgan is honoring the beliefs of his mentor eastman by imposing those beliefs on the rest of the group thus  risking the lives of those around him not just his own eastman was really only taking a chance with his own life  and tabitha s  when he let morgan live but morgan is playing with fire  making decisions that affect more people than just himself  morgan does nt want to kill anymore because of his self awakening  leaving everyone at risk at least carol is willing to kill anyone in order to save those she loves when i think about morgan  it s quite selfish of him if you ask me ,d02macy,thewalkingdead,television,1455670468.0,ana_BANANAS,1.0,0.0,35,1773,0.0
579,morgan was right  but his method was wrong  denise is what really swayed him  people who change can change again morgan is just terrible with his execution whats his face had morgan in a cage  morgan was stupid for not trying to open to door and led himself to believe it was locked this wolf was not fooled by anything and just waiting for his moment he knew that escaping early on was pointless ,d02pbmf,thewalkingdead,television,1455675101.0,KiNGofKiNG89,1.0,0.0,1,18477,0.0
580,i do nt think it s so black and white absolutely carol was in the wrong because she s too absolute on how she views people  and the wolf s actions after he s shot definitely illustrates this but morgan s actions initially put denise in danger  and when he wakes up he realizes that too   jss  covered both of their flawed outlooks very well both characters are capable of fending of the attackers  but both of their outlooks are extremely absolute carol s definitely left less loose ends  but she s sacrificing her morality  as evidenced by how she treats sam earlier on the shot of them going opposite ways on the road really showed  not only their differences  but how far gone both of them are ,d01ym0j,thewalkingdead,television,1455637057.0,Day5225,18.0,0.0,1150,31217,0.0

610,meet their end in the season finale   1 daryl this is the most obvious for me  with daryl now being the one who killed negan s scouting party  the symbolism of the blood on his wings  and the promise that we ll see more of him this second half norman reedus is also getting more and more movie deals  so i m sure his time is up he s been the fan favorite for nearly 5 years  and i m sure the writers  gimple  and kirkman have been cooking this up for a while  which may be the biggest blow to the show since hershel s death   2 glenn part of me prefers him to die  as it would have the most impact storywise  and  given the context of the comics  it s possibly the single greatestmost horrifying introduction to a villain in comic book history  but i feel like they re only teasing him dying and being saved at the last minute just to trick all the comic readers into being set in their expectations i think that they think that we think it s the most obvious thing to do  and most people expect to see that on their screens  but  they do nt want to follow the comics exactly in this case  which leads into   3 morgan this is the most interesting choice for me there s some  morgan sacrifices himself in place of x   theories  which i feel would lend some great kudos to the writers  but  i do nt think would work out at all  given the villain we re expecting it would make sense for morgan to beg and plead for him to die instead  as he has no real family left  and many of the group have been having major trouble with him  even though in s6e09 he claims to finally have realized what he now needs to do in order to stay in the group   it would be the ultimate sacrifice  but i do nt think negan would have any of that shit he is nt emotional  forgiving  or really logical in most cases  so i highly doubt he d just go  oh  yeah  sorry about that  x   i ll take this guy instead bring him up   4 spencer i do nt think he ll be present when negan shows up  but i feel like it would be similar to my morgan scenario spencer has no family anymore and does nt have any significant other that we know of in alexandria the only reason why i even put him in on the list  really low  at that  is because he is nt a major character in any way  and is more likely a candidate for his comic death   5 abraham this is the one i doubt the most kirkman himself has said that he regrets killing him off so early  and that he wishes he would have been around for the allout war arc  so i feel like he wo nt be getting the arrow death nor meet lucille anytime soon i expect him to be gone by the end of the show s adaptation of the allout war arc  maybe as the season 7 finale or season 8 midseason finale  anywhere between season 7 and 9  really ,463uvf,thewalkingdead,television,1455647828.0,imightbeidioteque,12.0,0.0,64,1301,0.0

682,i think the point was supposed to be that she was stuck up there with a swarm of walkers underneath her and no easy way to get down without injury or getting eaten if you are stuck somewhere for hours  are you going to choose to stay on the larger platform with railings and room to sitlay down  and a better vantage point of your surroundings  or are you going to choose to stand on a skinny metal railing with no handholds  enid s purpose was to fashion together some kind of rope using the church crap so they could climb down the other side of the wall where presumably there were few or no zombies and they would have a better chance to escape  i ca nt remember if maggie got hurt or not before she got up there  but it sounds like from some comments she was  so again  it makes more sense for her to stay where there s at least a railing and room to hang out  if the platform was really about to collapse  maggie would have obviously gone onto the metal thing  or if there was no other option  jumped over the wall and probably broken some bones  which would probably have ended up killing her eventually as she d not be able to runfight off walkers so it made more sense for her to stay put until the horde had passed an injury can mean death in this world  as evidenced by that stupid girl a few episodes back who twisted her ankle and got eaten later that episode when they were trying to draw the horde to the quarry  the whole thing with the horde making the platform shake and glenn panicking was just drama for the sake of tv and yes  that was dumb  but it made for a more exciting scene than maggie calmly dragging herself on to the metal thing and laying down until the situation was sorted  as for getting up and killing zombies later if she was injured  maybe that s lazy writing  or maybe her injury was nt that bad  or it was just adrenaline kicking in  there s been dumber things on this show than this metal railingplatform thing so it did nt bother me much ,d024jfn,thewalkingdead,television,1455645565.0,gettingzen,5.0,0.0,257,1766,0.0

684,when he offered to take judith back to the church  i agree with you  i didnt trust him at first but  seeing him walk away from the group with her and he just slowly shuffle towards the church it made sense that rick let him take her before rick and co met him at his church  and even up to his big speech  gabriel hasnt killed anyone he survived by moving around them too yes he had a lot of food in his church  but he also did some recon around the area and knew where food was and was not as risky as it was  next to rick and michonne  he has the most experience creeping around the dead undetected i also dont think gabriel hates rick  but hates that rick hates him it was his time to help out after all rick and co has done for him ,d02aw4a,thewalkingdead,television,1455654118.0,1800jerkstore,3.0,0.0,1,48,0.0

689,i love this show  but there is a lot of shit in this show that drives me bananas just like this   nobody ever wears any kind of armor just a leather jacket would give  some  sort of protection from bites and most of the time when people get bit its on the arm  and while they re doing something stupid like tyrese  he was just staring at a picture on the wall  i assume thinking  twins  twins  twins  what does it mean  twins there are 2 of them   at which time he gets bit on the arm at this point they should be clearing areas  armed and with proper armor  before they go sightseeing   they  should  be trying to be quiet when the zeds are close  but instead have entire conversations when they re  right in the middle of a fucking horde of zombies   and rick is the loudest of them all   and if zombie guts covered clothing makes them virtually invisible to the zeds  then why are nt they calmly slaying them by the hundred wearing zombie guts covered armor and using spears   somehow  the second someone becomes a zombie in this show  their skull turns into paper mach  and you can just easily slide a knife in there and magically hit that  one spot  that turns them off like a light switch people who die and return as a zombie 2 minutes later are also somehow rotten and their clothing is automatically all fucked up   this show is based on the romero zombie moviesworld  and in those movies  zombies  like everything on this planet  are  afraid  of fire but in this show  and seemingly only when they need it to the zombies are attracted to fire and will stupidly just walk right into it and stand there until they burn up   it s been several years since the apocalypse has taken over  yet every time they find a vehicle is miraculously full of good gasoline and the keys are in the ignition   daryl dixon rides the loudest vehicle you can find  to be a stealthy tracking ranger type with a silent crossbow   everyone is a headshot master  whether they ve ever held a gun before or not   no one ever uses any spears    that baby should be dead   all guns have unlimited ammo until the plot demands them to be out   people put themselves in dangerous situations that there is absolutely no reason to do so   characters are either good or evil  there is no in between you re either a murderous  abusive  snarky asshole whose bent on the destruction of the group  or you re part of the goody two shoes group there are no grey areas  etc ,d027v0a,thewalkingdead,television,1455650063.0,DoctorDeath,3.0,0.0,15402,120183,0.0

920,i think it was after the wolf got bit denise  without hesitation  offers to save his life if he can get her to safety of course  at this point she could have just run or pushed him into more walkers  but she tries to save him when they make it to shelter  the wolf looks dazed and maybe deep in contemplation  i think it was this action that turned the wolf every second before that  he just needed her to help him survive ,d023uoq,thewalkingdead,television,1455644632.0,bezzzerk,17.0,0.0,0,0,

922,still carol is still not nearly at fault on any of this as morgan is yes some issues arised that she indirectly caused but the main problems all stemed from morgan  the wolves attacking  morgan did nt kill them after he first met them in the s5 finale which led to the group having to head back to alexandria in the middle of trying to draw the herd away  during the attack morgan wasted time to tie one up while people around him died then he lets a group of them escape with a gun which leads to attempt  2 to draw the herd away being thwarted because that group destroys the rv and rick almost dies trying to deal with them  after the attack instead of killing the wolf again morgan leads the only doctor in alexandria there and wastes medicine on him while he keeps the wolf locked up risking the lives of the people around him once more  then when carol tries to kill the wolf morgan gets in the way and ruins everything allowing the wolf to take denise and escape  yes carol could ve waited but it is inarguably morgan s fault for allowing that wolf to live  the wolf then threatens denise and in the end saves her but only because he needs help carol shoots him and denise lives had the wolf somehow lived would you seriously trust the wolf   come on he changed so quickly what makes you think he wo nt change back  carol may be cold but it is exactly what s needed to protect the peopleshe loves to say that she is as bad as morgan or unhinged like him takes some serious mental gymnastics her ideology is based on facing reality morgan s is based on living in a fairytale  oh and did you want to cover the whole threatening sam in the armory last season  okay carol goes to steal guns because the group has not had a single runin with a good group of people to date and they were forced to disarm when they walked in alexandria and warned they would be thrown out if they did nt obey the  ridiculous  rules instead of watching her child jessie lets him nose around and sam finds carol in the armory carol attempts to bribe him with cookies if he does nt tell anyone he does nt care and says he is going to tell his mom at this point carol s options are to a let the entire group get thrown out or b make up a story to scare sam into being quiet being a rational person carol chooses b was she seriously supposed to anticipate that he was going to freak out because a herd of walkers was going to break in in the future  ca nt blame her for not wanting to get connected with another child after the ones she has had to deal with in a way she was also preparing him by being mean to him and showing him that the world is not a nice place  carol is not a crazy person her ideology may seem harsh and cold but it makes sense and she does whatever is necessary to protect the group that is something everyone should follow comparing her to morgan is idiotic and flat out incorrect ,d0224d5,thewalkingdead,television,1455642229.0,Pumpkinpilot,6.0,0.0,0,0,

2353,amazing  our experience of it really could nt be more opposite  i felt like this was an episode that played out closer to its comic counterpart than any other major storyline has if i m not mistaken  jessie and sam are the first somewhat important characters to get the same death at the same time on the show as they did in the comics  in an episode that just showed us a kid being torn apart  no way were they killing glen ambiguously in a panned out shot of him being overtaken i was nt worried anyway  but as soon as they cut to that shot  i was 100  sure he was safe i m surprised they resolved that immediately instead of cutting to another scene before showing us abraham and sasha saving him  i did also like gabriel s speech  though  edit  i did forget show sam  comic ron  so not exactly the same character  but he did take over that role ,d01txdp,thewalkingdead,television,1455627530.0,LastKnownBison,37.0,0.0,1,1201,0.0

3015,i know i am going to be bashed to oblivion for this but for me it was one of the worst episodes of the walking dead  coming from someone who has overall enjoyed the entire show so far  with some episodes being weaker than others of course   but i just have to get it off my chest  first thing that annoyed me  slightly   was that somehow no one heard daryl struggling with the guy  hell why did they even let daryl go 1 on 1 with the guy  that s obviously a terrible idea considering you expect there to be guns but this was a really minor issue and daryl blowing up that bunch was far worth it  now onto my real gripes with the episode  mid season finale cliff hanger with sam calling for  mom   scrapped what the hell  after that  ok rick s group walks out in the middle of the day  yet hours later in the pitch black night they are still walking through alexandria  again what  and here comes the nasty  i do not give one care about sam getting killed but seriously the whole scene played out so dumbly  it s just a goddamn kid  dude pick him up  shut his mouth or simply drag him by force or better yet knock his ass unconcious and carry him i have seen moms more fiercely force a kid on the sidewalk in a regular day than these people they just turned off their brains  i mean it s fine that the mom does it but one would think rickcarlmichonne would come with a better solution than trying to convince an unstable  panicking kid in the middle of a horde than by talking to him why not at least hug him and cover his eyes  drag him like that  what the fuck happened to any kind of logic  and then jessie freaks out  understandable  yet again rickcarlmichonne just stand there like idiots while jessie attracts the whole horde on them so rick just freaked out as well  after seeing all the shit from all seasons and being in his most hardened state  after telling so much how these people are hopeless and wo nt make it like 2 hours earlier now he freaks out because the kid whose death could be seen from a mile away got killed  great  and then prick teenager freaks out and decides to gun carl  i mean why does he even still have a gun  but whatever  carl had a brain fart on that and left the teenager who tried to kill him armed with a gun despite endagering everyone including judith by that teenagers i guess but then great michonne decides to take care of him  finally something nearly logical  too bad she had to dispose of him in the most nonlethal way to give him enough time to shoot carl  oh and to let him possibly die a horrible dead while he s eaten alive instead of going for a switf instant kill by like stabbing his head or something like that  she s the sword expert not me   but well heat of the moment i guess and at least carl s going to get a sweet eye patch  and then even more  glenn with his suicidal charge to save his wife oh wait here comes ginger with his automatic rifle and hits every zombie in the head going full auto  even the ones that were like 1 meter away from glenn  dude s obviously cheating with an aimbot   and yay glenn once again avoids certain doom in a ridiculous fashion  and then rick goes on a solo killing spree to  inspire  the alexandrians  cough  psychotic attack  cough   first how did he even last more than 5 seconds is beyond me  i guess the hundreds zombies were leaving a convenient path for rick to keep walking through without surrounding him  despite we have seen that s not how the horde acts in other episodes where they relentlessly and brutally surround people without leaving gaps  whatever these zombies just cassualy try to attack rick but mostly just keep passively wandering around like nothing s up then some more people go to  what i presumed  was rescuing rick from getting killed except not rick s senseless actions somehow inspired everyone into jumping to certain deaths  before the fire was even set   and what s worse is that it worked  they killed off thousands of zombies in melee range  not one weapon got stuck in a zombie s head  not one guy tripped in a zombie corspe  not a single guy got distracted or too tired to go on they melee bashed zombie skulls the entire night without a single casualty  even the inept alexandrians turned into spartan mode both courage and skill wise at least after the fire was set on it made more sense but the first bunch of people just happily went to their deaths  oh and good idea to use a rocket launcher just to light some fuel daryl cool i guess  that and now fire now apparently draws zombies to just literally walk to their deaths  why does nt rick just go with a smelly poncho a make a few fires here and there boom whole city is cleared from zombies i do nt even know how they will ever make zombie s look like a remotely threating force after this  this was the darkest and direst scenario and they solved it just like this after the midseason finale our characters can apparently hack through hundreds of zombies with just a few people  and they can just light a fire while wearing ponchos  without unstable teenagers  to solve any big horde problem anyway implying the show wo nt just make them forget i know from this ranting post it sounds like i hate the show or something but no i am usually willing to overlook plenty of things for the sake of story telling but this episode just went on and on and on with constant sillyness and mostly for senseless gratification even i expect some degree of realism and logic from this show  considering it has mostly been logical with few forgivable exceptions up to this episode it just felt like the show turned from a semirealistic zombie drama to michael bay s the walking dead  but with low budget explosions
