439,440,i believe it former journalism outfits that had name recognition are basically stooping to the level of a blogger or ad network that will put out knowingly incorrect information or will sometimes just straight up lie in order to create a graph showing the number of hits their articles are hitting so they can sell the traffic to the highest bidder  these outfits do nt have to worry about their names being tarnished bc they can just start up a new site  migrate the content and no one is the wiser  there is a great book written by ryan holiday in which he spent about 6 months claiming to be an expert on a site journalist use who are already know what they want to say but need a source to quote  he was quoted as an expert in fields he had no clue about  in several very reputable organizations articles  nyt  washington post   he used his real name the entire time and all the  journalist  would have had to do was do even minimal research to discover he had already gotten a ton of press exposing media corruption  eventually he had his assistant pretending to be him and he was still getting quoted  the great part was once he revealed he had basically duped all these publishing outfits they were outraged at him for lying nevermind the fact the journalist did no fact checking whatsoever and in some cases never communicated with him in any form other than email  this is the type of journalistic integrity we have going on so i absolutely believe this ,d015aen,offbeat,news,1455573919,mymainthrowaway,18,0,10,765,0.0

771,772,greetings to you in the name of god i am so much happy to have received your message and i thank god who in his infinite knowledge has directed me towards you for his service may his purpose be brought to manifestation in jesus name  the reason for which i contacted you is to solicit for your service for uplifting the orphans and underprivileged i inherited this money from my late husband and i don  t know how much the accrued interest on the money for the past few years the money has been lying in the custody of bank of africa  boa   i have made up of my mind to entrust the fund in your care to be distributed to charitable organisation in any country that mostly need some support and to other i want the money to reach the less privileged in the society  especially the motherless children  the orphans and the handicapped i intended to keep the money for my adopted child but unfortunately  my adopted child got involved in a bus accident while returning back from school and he died i finally made up my mind to donate out this fund after being diagnosed of cancer by my doctor that was few months ago recently  my doctor insisted that i must go for surgical operation  or else  it would get to uncontrollable stage he also made me to understand that my chances of surviving the operation would be 5050 and that the surgery operation must be done based on that  i decided that i have to will off the fund to the suffering children first before going for the operation  in view of the above  i want you to assure me that you are going to utilize this money that i am about to entrust in your care  that the money would not be used in some other things that are not in line with what i have proposed for the money please  i want you to write back to me and acknowledge to me that the money must be used judiciously once i receive your response to this message  and if your vision towards this project is acceptable with me  i shall then put you in contact with my late husband  s lawyer in ivory coast  barrister david anan  who is going to work hand in hand with you for transfer of the money to you  because i may not be able to communicate again once am placed on medical supervision for my operation coming up next week  please  i want you to put me in your prayers always i am not yet discouraged i believe by his grace  my operation would be a successful one  i am impatiently waiting for your reply  yours faithfully  mrscatherine peters,czzo4yw,offbeat,news,1455468600,imafuckinzombie,4,0,1,380,0.0

4780,4781,i believe it former journalism outfits that had name recognition are basically stooping to the level of a blogger or ad network that will put out knowingly incorrect information or will sometimes just straight up lie in order to create a graph showing the number of hits their articles are hitting so they can sell the traffic to the highest bidder  these outfits do nt have to worry about their names being tarnished bc they can just start up a new site  migrate the content and no one is the wiser  there is a great book written by ryan holiday in which he spent about 6 months claiming to be an expert on a site journalist use who are already know what they want to say but need a source to quote  he was quoted as an expert in fields he had no clue about  in several very reputable organizations articles  nyt  washington post   he used his real name the entire time and all the  journalist  would have had to do was do even minimal research to discover he had already gotten a ton of press exposing media corruption  eventually he had his assistant pretending to be him and he was still getting quoted  the great part was once he revealed he had basically duped all these publishing outfits they were outraged at him for lying nevermind the fact the journalist did no fact checking whatsoever and in some cases never communicated with him in any form other than email  this is the type of journalistic integrity we have going on so i absolutely believe this ,d015aen,offbeat,news,1455573919,mymainthrowaway,16,0,10,765,0.0

19744,19745,i believe it former journalism outfits that had name recognition are basically stooping to the level of a blogger or ad network that will put out knowingly incorrect information or will sometimes just straight up lie in order to create a graph showing the number of hits their articles are hitting so they can sell the traffic to the highest bidder  these outfits do nt have to worry about their names being tarnished bc they can just start up a new site  migrate the content and no one is the wiser  there is a great book written by ryan holiday in which he spent about 6 months claiming to be an expert on a site journalist use who are already know what they want to say but need a source to quote  he was quoted as an expert in fields he had no clue about  in several very reputable organizations articles  nyt  washington post   he used his real name the entire time and all the  journalist  would have had to do was do even minimal research to discover he had already gotten a ton of press exposing media corruption  eventually he had his assistant pretending to be him and he was still getting quoted  the great part was once he revealed he had basically duped all these publishing outfits they were outraged at him for lying nevermind the fact the journalist did no fact checking whatsoever and in some cases never communicated with him in any form other than email  this is the type of journalistic integrity we have going on so i absolutely believe this ,d015aen,offbeat,news,1455573919,mymainthrowaway,17,0,10,765,0.0
