57,58,if you read between the lines  that s exactly what she s saying here  see  most public schools have zerotolerance policies this means that students who violate those policies are punished  period  keep in mind  one of the main reasons that zerotolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur  it just so happens  to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a  diverse  school  that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than white or asian students  and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school  so hillary is saying that treating people equally and in an entirely colorblind manner is  discrimination  because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students  and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students  so her plan is to spend two billion dollars   200000000000  of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students  regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules   put another way  let s say there is a school with 1000 students  500 of whom are white and 500 who are black if 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester  and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame  then under existing zerotolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished to a sane  ie  nonliberal  person  this makes sense and seems fair however  hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination  since only 4  of the white students were punished over the semester while 20  of the black students were punished so hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school this can be achieved either by a  punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished  or b  declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished  which one do you think is more likely to happen   this is the democrat party in 2016  folks pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people ,d02dwhd,conservative,news,1455658094,wiseprogressivethink,1,0,137571,11206,0.0

109,110,as much as one would hope attacking trumps conservative bona fides would be effective  i think the rules are different this year  i am no trump supporter  and if he is the nominee  well i probably will pull the plug for him over a clinton or a sanders it is right back into the  who is worse  decision we have had the last several election cycles  i think this election is different this president has so thoroughly screwed up on the basics that the voter is keenly aware that you can not take those basics for granted his stimulus spending and the economy was an utter disaster  and we could have probably emerged from this recession sooner had we not gone down that path his attempt to nationalize the health care industry has been utter failure  generating 30hr work weeks his wide open border immigration policy has glutted the market with unskilled labor that drains the safety net and our public school system  and depresses wages for citizens who traditionally worked them his foreign policy apology tour  russian reset  picking the muslim brotherhood in egypt  drawing red lines then doing nothing  blaming terrorist action on a youtube video rather than the secretary s optics policiesall of this is screw up on all the basics  so when trump goes out there and thumps his chest on immigration  or he talks about building up the military  or running the economy like a business  and not once apologizing for the nation he loves  people see he has the basics right over and over he hammers on these basics all his focus is on that  and people understand it  so when a paul or a cruz gets up there and makes a nuanced consitutional point  they do nt really get it  and they come back to trump  and how he is going to be the payback for what this president screwed up  when a bush or a rubio or a kasich gives their usual wormy response about pathways to citizenship  the public most clearly knows that not a single one of them has the basics right they go back to trump who is there hammering home deportations and walls  so by pushing depth and breadth of issues and ignoring the basics  this field facing trump really do not get the mood of this public obama has so royally screwed up  that we can no longer count on basics these other candidates could stand to learn from trump and drive home the basics more they could stand to learn from reagan who was a master at educating the public on the basics of free market v socialism  until it is clear any candidate has the basics seared into their brains and knows what their marching orders are from their boss  the american people  trump will still draw off votes with the basics  and the public will ignore depth and breadth issues take that wind out of his sails and a harder look at depth and breadth is in order ,d029ugy,conservative,news,1455652717,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0.0

384,385,the democrats have been the party of racists since their very beginning they seceded from the union before lincoln  the socalled father of the republican party  could abolish slavery  they founded the kkk  and they greatly stunted minority economic progress with the advent of the welfare state the fact is blacks experienced their greatest period of progress by proving to every white man that they did nt just deserve to be looked upon as equals they earned it they did this in the face of all the legal and even statemandated racism that occurred at the time the welfare state marked the end of decreasing black poverty  a sad fact that still haunts our society today  i strongly believe that these socalled liberals are supremely racist they believe that we need lower standards for blacks to gain admittance to the same schools we believe intelligence and standards should nt be judged by race  and no matter what race you are  your achievements are tied to your merits they are elitists who believe that poor americans  many of whom are black  need their help in order to succeed  rather than getting out of their way and allowing them to work moreover  these collectivists believe in class and identity warfare  rather than diversity of individual opinion they believe blacks who do not share the same opinion on slavery reparations or affirmative action are nt real blacks  much the same way they believe women who are prolife are nt real women they believe ben carson  thomas sowell  and clarence thomas are nt real blacks they believe sarah palin  carly fiorina  and michele bachmann are nt real women they believe ted cruz and marco rubio are nt real hispanics  looking at you  new york times   the democratic party has always been  and will always be  the party of racists the only thing that changed in their philosophy is they convinced themselves that the racist acts they commit  racist beliefs they hold  and racist policies they support are actually beneficial for society as a whole ,d01vjbb,conservative,news,1455631442,TreadNotOnMe,164,0,162,406,1.0

671,672,for those of you who do nt believe in voter fraud or think it is nt a big deal  you are wrong  here are some facts  a dramatic example of fraud was revealed by a new york state grand jury the grand jury detailed a widespread conspiracy that operated without detection for 14 years in brooklyn this conspiracy involved not only impersonation of legitimate voters at the polls  but also voting under fictitious names as a result  thousands of fraudulent votes were cast in state and congressional elections  one of the witnesses before the grand jury described how he led a crew of eight individuals from polling place to polling place to vote each member of his crew voted in excess of 20 times  and there were approximately 20 other such crews operating during that election  a study by the university of missouri on turnout in indiana showed that turnout actually increased by about 2 percentage points overall in indiana in 2006 in the first election after the voter id law went into effect  a study by the university of delaware and the university of nebraska  lincoln examined data from the 2000  2002  2004  and 2006 elections at both the aggregate and individual levels  the study found that voter id laws do not affect turnout  including across racialethnicsocioeconomic lines the study concludes that  concerns about voter identification laws affecting turnout are much ado about nothing  the colorado secretary of state recently testified before congress that a check of the voter registration rolls indicated over 11000 individuals who were noncitizens at the time they registered to vote  at least 5000 of whom likely voted  a georgia voter id requirement went into effect when it was upheld in final orders issued by every state and federal court in georgia that reviewed the law  including the eleventh circuit court of appeals and  most recently  the georgia supreme court as these courts held  such an id requirement is not discriminatory and does not violate the constitution or any federal voting rights laws  including the voting rights act of 1965 in georgia  as has happened in every state that has considered voter id legislation  organizations like the aclu and the naacp made specious claims that there were hundreds of thousands of voters without photo id yet when dismissing all of their claims  the federal court pointed out that after two years of litigation  none of the plaintiff organizations like the naacp had been able to produce a single individual or member who did not have a photo id or could not easily obtain one  america is one of the only democracies in the world that does not uniformly require voters to present photo id when they vote across the globe  democracies administer such a requirement without any problems and without any reports that their citizens are in any way burdened when voting  in fact  america  s southern neighbor mexico  which has a much larger rate of poverty than the united states  requires both a photo id and a thumbprint to vote  and turnout has increased in mexican elections since this requirement went into effect in the 1990s mexico  s voter id laws are also credited with reducing the fraud that had prevailed in many mexican elections and  allowing the 2000 election of vicente fox  the first opposition party candidate to be elected president of mexico in seventy years  this can do nothing but help keep people honest any fraud is theft of rights from someone else the electoral system can not inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters as the us supreme court has noted  voter id protects the integrity and reliability of the electoral process  if anything  the evidence has shown that voter id laws actually increased democratic voter turnout  voter id can prevent and deter  impersonation fraud at the polls  voting under fictitious voter registrations  double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality  and voting by illegal aliens  or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since state and federal elections are restricted to us citizens  from your boy bernie   voter fraud is  in fact  a serious crime in my view it should be punished   bernie sanders looks like he and i do nt disagree on everything ,d01se06,conservative,news,1455622520,Indominus_Rex,6,0,61,157,0.0

3681,3682,for those of you who do nt believe in voter fraud or think it is nt a big deal  you are wrong  here are some facts  a dramatic example of fraud was revealed by a new york state grand jury the grand jury detailed a widespread conspiracy that operated without detection for 14 years in brooklyn this conspiracy involved not only impersonation of legitimate voters at the polls  but also voting under fictitious names as a result  thousands of fraudulent votes were cast in state and congressional elections  one of the witnesses before the grand jury described how he led a crew of eight individuals from polling place to polling place to vote each member of his crew voted in excess of 20 times  and there were approximately 20 other such crews operating during that election  a study by the university of missouri on turnout in indiana showed that turnout actually increased by about 2 percentage points overall in indiana in 2006 in the first election after the voter id law went into effect  a study by the university of delaware and the university of nebraska  lincoln examined data from the 2000  2002  2004  and 2006 elections at both the aggregate and individual levels  the study found that voter id laws do not affect turnout  including across racialethnicsocioeconomic lines the study concludes that  concerns about voter identification laws affecting turnout are much ado about nothing  the colorado secretary of state recently testified before congress that a check of the voter registration rolls indicated over 11000 individuals who were noncitizens at the time they registered to vote  at least 5000 of whom likely voted  a georgia voter id requirement went into effect when it was upheld in final orders issued by every state and federal court in georgia that reviewed the law  including the eleventh circuit court of appeals and  most recently  the georgia supreme court as these courts held  such an id requirement is not discriminatory and does not violate the constitution or any federal voting rights laws  including the voting rights act of 1965 in georgia  as has happened in every state that has considered voter id legislation  organizations like the aclu and the naacp made specious claims that there were hundreds of thousands of voters without photo id yet when dismissing all of their claims  the federal court pointed out that after two years of litigation  none of the plaintiff organizations like the naacp had been able to produce a single individual or member who did not have a photo id or could not easily obtain one  america is one of the only democracies in the world that does not uniformly require voters to present photo id when they vote across the globe  democracies administer such a requirement without any problems and without any reports that their citizens are in any way burdened when voting  in fact  america  s southern neighbor mexico  which has a much larger rate of poverty than the united states  requires both a photo id and a thumbprint to vote  and turnout has increased in mexican elections since this requirement went into effect in the 1990s mexico  s voter id laws are also credited with reducing the fraud that had prevailed in many mexican elections and  allowing the 2000 election of vicente fox  the first opposition party candidate to be elected president of mexico in seventy years  this can do nothing but help keep people honest any fraud is theft of rights from someone else the electoral system can not inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters as the us supreme court has noted  voter id protects the integrity and reliability of the electoral process  if anything  the evidence has shown that voter id laws actually increased democratic voter turnout  voter id can prevent and deter  impersonation fraud at the polls  voting under fictitious voter registrations  double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality  and voting by illegal aliens  or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since state and federal elections are restricted to us citizens  from your boy bernie   voter fraud is  in fact  a serious crime in my view it should be punished   bernie sanders looks like he and i do nt disagree on everything ,d01se06,conservative,news,1455622520,Indominus_Rex,5,0,61,157,0.0

9684,9685,what i would love to see in this thread is how much money the responders and commenters earn in a year  i live in an area that is very conservative due to religious beliefs that is fine and good but most of the republican candidates push agendas to help the rich and corporate entities they do nt help the poor  as the bible says you should do yet they lean on that book to get their votes  i have voted in a republican primary since i was 18 i voted mainly for republican candidates around 75  of the time i was very big in the party in the early 90s and was connected to the republican legislature and governor of my state then things started changing i did nt leave the partyit left me  i work with poor people and uneducated people i see students who try to work a job for high school credit but have to quit because the state says they are making too much money and their child will lose health benefits from a job flipping burgers  nobody wants freeloaders neither party wants that  but we should help people get up corporate greed has kept wages low go to walmart and see if those people can live a decent life on forty hours a week  they are working and that is what we want but they can barely afford much to live we have given the banks  investment firms  and large companies tax breaks for years and we even bailed them out is nt that welfare  do they need that  i say no especially when you see a company on wall street giving out huge bonuses after the bail out  to be a part of the 1  you need to earn about  400000 a year i highly doubt anyone on reddit earns that kind of money  so what i do nt get and i have seen this in my local community how do people continue to vote republican candidates in when they will turn around and not vote for the middle class and poorthe 99  of us why  basically they lie and spread fear i saw it in the campaigns i was a part of they made people believe someone like obama would take away their guns and god i did nt vote for the man but let s be honest has he really taken away any of our freedoms  what is extremely sad is that we do nt have any more moderates my state saw one of the most senior statesman of our time get taken out by an ultra conservative just because he did what was best for the county i am talking about senator lugar the guy who beat him lost in the main election to a democrat in a very conservative state  politics has divided us as a country it has spread hate and fear maybe it is time we shake this country up trump is nt going to do it he will line his own pockets  i lost around  60000 in my retirement in the economic downturn in 2009 many americans lost money at that time they lost value in their homes as well did the 1  suffer that much  nothey were insulated and bailed out  all i ask is look at your own earnings and say to me that a billionaire is going to help you out they wo nt and they never will we need change in this country and not the hate filled stuff coming out of trump s mouth or the lies told to us by cruz or rubio  yea i rambled i apologize for misspelled words and poor grammar i am on mobile and i can not type or see the screen that well blow up my inbox if you will but take a hard look at your situation before you do truly look at what we have allowed to go on in this country for far too long i am not saying bernie sanders is the answer but he is one who is not afraid of the big corporations that run the country hopefully he makes us rethink about we have done ,d01wlq3,conservative,news,1455633588,snowcrash31,4,0,1,544,0.0
