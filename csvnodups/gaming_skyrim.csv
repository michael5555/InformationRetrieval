67,68,  magic resistance   is capped at 85   elemental resistance is also capped at 85   but it is calculated separately from magic resistance  so you can stack  say  fire resistance on top of magic resistance however  in this case  elemental resistance is calculated as percentage of the damage not blocked by the magic resistance for instance  if i have 80  magic resistance and 20  fire resistance  that does nt mean i resist 100  of fire damage it means i resist 80  of fire damage  plus 20  of the remaining 20  that is nt taken care of by my magic resistance so stacking a 20  fire resistance item or potion on top of 80  magic resistance only yields an extra 4  resistance to fire  for 84  total on the other hand  you can stack capped elemental resistance on top of capped magic resistance  so that you resist 9775  of each spell  85  magic resistance  and 85  of the remaining 15      spell cost   can be reduced to zero with sufficiently high enchanting skill but you can only do this for two magic schools  since the most you can get on a single item is a 25  cost reduction  and you can only put two enchantments on each item also note that the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from enchanting is different from the fortify lt  spell schoolgt  effect you get from potions having  say  an amulet with 20  fortify destruction reduces your spell cost by 20   but a potion that grants 20  fortify destruction increases your spell damage by 20   there are nt gear pieces that improve your enchanting  because there is no fortify enchanting enchantment  only fortify enchanting potions but this can still be used for   maximizing enchantment power    check out  this brief guide   http  wwwuespnetwikiskyrim  enchanting  maximizing_enchantment_power  on the wiki the basic idea is to get a kind of feedback loop going between fortify enchanting potions and fortify alchemy enchantments  brief a fortify enchanting potion  then make a fortify alchemy enchantment while under that potion s effects  which you can use to make an even more powerful fortify enchanting potion  and so on however  the most powerful fortify enchanting potion you re going to be able to make no matter what is somewhere between 40  50   depending on what patches you re using ,d012h14,skyrim,gaming,1455569797,Grundlage,2,0,27,1317,0.0

80,81,i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,d01bg2z,skyrim,gaming,1455583606,sloogz,10,0,337,4059,0.0

291,292,oh man  i ll give you the run down on how to level quick and make a lot of gold in the process you ll need to delve into dungeons to get started as well as keep this going  so you should nt get too bored  first and foremost  some rules  1  whenever you see any weapon or armor or ring that is enchanted  pocket it and disenchant it at an altar so you can enchant other weapons with its effects  2  grab all soul gems you see  3  any iron  silver or gold oreingot pocket it as well 4  do nt buy anything except ingots and ores they are sold at blacksmiths whiterun is ideal because there are 3 people you can buy from  first  you ll want to go north of whiterun to halted stream camp there is a ton of iron mines there  and an awesome spell called transmute this take iron ore and turns it into silvergold ore this makes your smithing increase more than iron would do  buy as much iron ingot and ore and make iron daggers and jewelry and then sell them off  a huge thing here that will change both your money and leveling drastically is to find a weapon that has soul trap on it  disenchant it and then use a soul gem to enchant a bowcrossbow with soul trap  since you likely are low level you ll only encounter petty and lesser soul gems fill these by walking around the whiterun plains and killing deer  mudcrabs  etc with your bow  now that you have a lot of filled soul gems  go make some daggers and jewelry  and then enchant them all with whatever enchantment and then sell them this will get you quite a bit of money  all while leveling enchanting and smithing you can now afford even more iron ingot to make more daggers to rinse and repeat  if you have the dawn guard expansion  the soul cairn is full of soul gems ripe for the taking if you are running low on them just go and restock  after you ve leveled your smithing a bit you ll want to unlock the dwarven smithing dwarven ingot is by far the most common and easy to stockpile in the game they are all found in dwarven ruins  and dwarven ingot can be smelted from many dwarven scrap metal you find lying around there  make dwarven bows  enchant  sell  some other tips  you can level conjuration easily by finding a mud crab and just recasting a summon spell like  conjure sword   it levels very fast the reason being is that you must be in combat to level conjuration  and the summon sword spell wo nt kill the mudcrab as long as you do nt attack it  also  you do nt need to specialize in skyrim  you can really do anything g with any character you want to focus on health and magic for your character  i d say your stamina should never go above 200 points unless you are very high level  the solitude blacksmith also has a ton of iron  steel  and silver ingot for you to loot just do nt get caught ,d023j98,skyrim,gaming,1455644191,hks9,11,0,94,17344,0.0

311,312,i need a satisfying skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller on a pc  i ve got a level 90 nord male with all perk trees at 100 i ve got all the black books so i can reconfigure perks at will i have a good gaming pc with an xbox 360 controller my problem right now is that i simply can not find a gratifying mage build and i ve tried more than a few ideas  satisfying is a relative concept for each gamer so let me offer my current frame of reference before you reply below i only describe the major chapters of my skyrim career by build                                           heavyarmor twohanded warrior i started playing on novice mode  during early learning curve  using heavy armor and twohanded build  somewhere around level 10 it got boring easy so i bumped to apprentice until i finished the main quest line  first thing  then bumped up to adept during this build i got to see more than a few of the coup de gras cut scenes  very satisfying my final build was legendary dragonplate with a legendary dragon bone hammer with healthstam regen enchants this is a very easy way to play i could easily rush 2 giants and 2 mammoths with maybe only a single health potion having satisified myself with this build i turned to an assassin build   lightarmor dagger assassin i turned to the dark brotherhood questlines and i donned all the best sneak armor i d collected along the way  wielding two dragonbone daggers  legendary   my sneak was already near to 100  and i went out at night to test drive my newb assassin build by my lakeside house and my very first kill was sneaking a vampire in the open dark of night and i got the 15x dagger backstab cut scene throat slice and i was blown away  absolutely fantastic badass gaming experience  my actual thought was this game just let me assassinate a vampire at night     during this time  i would always grab my two hander to deal with random dragons merely to save on potions because i could put any dragon down in two hits before any serious damage but with the daggers not so easy i easily completed all brotherhood quests and was very satisfied with this build   sneak sniper i decided that i wanted to experience dragon slaying without the twohander so i turned to my dragon bone bow  legendary  and trained archery full 100 and ran all the thieves guild quests and it was insane like shooting drunken comatose ducks in a pond this was the first moment i really felt like i was cheating even though i was not although i usually did need a potion or two  i could put down any random dragon with my bow typical potion sequence was a 55  magic resist and a single full health  i finished all the thieves guild quest lines this way it was great and the cut kill scenes with the flying arrows are very satisfying   zerker dual wield i still did not have lightarmor max d because sneaking is such that you rarely get hit and thus you do nt train in addition  onehanded was not max d because daggers and bows do nt count so i turned my attention to a lightarmor  dragonscale legendary  dual wield dragonbone dagger left hand and dragonbone mace right hand  both legendary   and i started clearing my very bloated quest log and chasing all the shouts and dragonborn content i ca nt say enough about this build  it is bleeping fantastic this is the only build that will let you literally sprint all the way thru any dungeon  or anywhere   i ve got enchanting max d so my dagger has stamina regen and soultrap and the mace has stamina regen and paralyze i can literally rush every target and beat it senseless in 12 seconds  including a legendary dragon  sometimes hardly ever getting hit most of the damage taken is from mages at range for me  zerkersprinting combat on legendary difficulty is a serious adrenaline rush i highly recommend the experience it is the most satisfying of each of the major 4 builds i ve described so far   note  i finished both the werewolf and vampire skill trees just to get the achievement but the gameplay was just a gimmick novelty and no where near as good as any of the 4 builds above   mage build     wtf         so once i decided i could not minmax my zerker build better  i finally turned my attention to a mage build i began by training all the 5 schools to 100 and completing all 5 of the college ritual quests so now i m the archmage with 100 s in all 5 trees and all the black books  and all shouts and powers  and i can not find any build that is even remotely close to satisfying it is not that there are not enough spells or that they do nt do some cool stuff  there are plenty of spells and cool fx   but rather that i simply can not find only 2 spells that i can wield such that i can solo an entire dungeon easily with an xbox 360 controller on a pc  so my question for all of you is to simply ask you to tell me how to enjoy a skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller and 2 spells  as far as i know i have every kind of item that can benefit a mage  but i ca nt get thru a dungeon without needing 510 spells and that reduces the skyrim mage experience to a big game of popup menu  not fun in the least   note that it is entirely ok to suggest that this is impossible because if it is then i want to know that it is so i do nt waste any more time i ll go back to my legendary zerker   edit  i failed to mention that i made a cheater ring with 3 million magicka  so spell cost is not an issue but even with this god level cheat  i still can not find a satisfying 2spell mage build and my current assessment is this  the magic system is not playable with only 2 spells this is why physical damage builds have value  because they are   playable   and that playability matters

356,357,try mixing things up with conjuration  restoration and alteration makes a mage build far more fun  smithing is easy just buy a bunch of leather and leather strips from a shop and then skip two days ahead using the time changer function  which should restock the materials  and do it over and over til you reach 100  for enchanting  mine a bunch of ore  smelt them  craft a bunch of jewelry  which could help with levelling smithing as well if you have nt fully completed levelling it  and then go to dawnstar  find the dawnstar chest  it s near a mining cave iirc watch a video on the dawnstar chest glitch since it s too well hidden to accurately pinpoint the location using text  which has a significant amount of soul gems and gold which you should loot  then go to the khaijit caravan  if they do nt show up  change the time until they do  right outside dawnstar  talk to atahbah and if her gold is at 1250 that means the chest reset  and if it is nt on 1250  just save your game  attack her  then load the save and her gold should reset to 1250 which means the chest has reset as well go back to the chest and then rince and repeat  alchemy takes a long time go to the es wiki  find all the recipes  and then get the ingredients via buying them or just finding them  you can find their locations in the wiki as well  and then create them until you reach 100 alchemy  ps  you have to complete the thieves guild mission regarding caravans to unlock atahbah as a fence try doing the enchanting thing when you progress a little further in the game ,d01yw22,skyrim,gaming,1455637503,KnightsofKnightobia,14,0,1,-7,0.0

434,435,there is a variety of things you can try to improve your magic flailing madman in the fantastic land of skyrim  as you said you have gone through everything there is to be the wonderful wizard of skyrim so let s get a good look at the various schools of magic and see what might fit you  1   alteration   a class for a magician who just wants to feelwell magical  this school as you may know is based around defenses and miscellaneous utilities essentially your  buff  school being a mage is a squishy life unlike the heavy plated beserking monstrosity that are mighty orc  the wall  warrior builds  mages tend to be as well defended as a wet napkin this can be offset later on with enchanting which i will talk about later but that s the bitch way son spells like stoneflesh and dragonskin put some hair on your pale wizard chest and get you ready to rumble in the cold harsh world however alteration shines the greatest when its just doing utility jobs with its tools such as candlelight  transmute  detect life  telekinesis  and paralysis  alteration can work with any school but is more or less a passive school  2   conjuration   imagine this a dragon swoops down and starts causing a ruckus on your hometown of  insert home here  but you just ca nt be bothered to get your soft magic hands dirty well then conjuration is the class for you  this school of magic lets you summon your wageless demonic slaves or undead minions to combat problems for you even awaken your inner goodguymagicman and banish the creatures of oblivion back to the shadow realm from whence they came but if you re the sort of person who s day is nt complete without killing it yourself well then conjuration allows you to summon weapons and bows as well  a pro at this school can have their own undead army or personal daedric escort to help you and your merry magical adventures across the land of skyrim hell you can even steal the souls of the living to use in your horrible  or purely academic  mad experiments by trapping them in soul gems with soul trap as long as you can kill them before the spell ends depending on how you play  this school can be either very hands on or very laid back whether you d decide to get up and personal with hell itself or just let your army of the damn deal with it on your behalf it is a very fun school that can work very well with alteration if you refuse to dawn even the most fragile of armors and restoration if you find yourself getting more than a scratch  3   destruction   now here s a fucking school of magic if you want to be a master of the element  s  that throws balls of explosive fire  bone chilling spikes of ice  or motherfucking sith lightning  then this is the school for you you can either focus into a specific element or branch out and enjoy what destruction has to offer now by endgame  with the proper perks invested such as impact  overpowered  you can essentially have enemies constantly stagger as you launch volley after volley of whatever flamingfrozenshocking projectile you can fling at them until they are nothing but smears on the floor each branch of destruction has their benefits and drawbacks fire works mostly with overtime damage and directly focuses on taking down an enemies health but is somewhat weaker  frost is excellent at slowing an enemy to a crawl and preventing power attacks but can be fairly wonky to work with and does the least damage of the 3 shock does the most damage and is the magician s natural predator as it will beat that magicka bar like it caught it cheating but it takes a ton of magicka to use their spells and cost the most of the 3 each one is a different playstyle and ultimately falls under player preference this school works exceptionally well with restoration as you may be the more offensive kinda guy and it is an offensive kinda school  4   illusion   you ever feel like you want to be a sneaky manipulative piece of shit but ca nt be bothered to do any actual fighting  welcome to the palpatine school of being a manipulative asshole illusion works great if you want to be stealthy and out of the way spells like pacify  fear  frenzy  can make sure you do nt ever have to worry about an enemy again because they either ran away  killed each other  or simply lost the will to be bothered other spells like rally do the opposite and make your allies  better  faster  and stronger which makes this work really well with conjuration if you are simply too shy to deal with people at all then muffle and invisibility are the introverted wizard s best friend  this school is a very supportsecondary school you use on top of your combat or lack thereof as it takes full advantage of a situation given you have the proper training because of this  it can be a school that works well outside of the sphere of the mage that warriors  thiefs  assassins and shifty pedophiles take complete advantage of the possibilities are endless  5   restoration   this is possibly the most essential school that a mage could invest in you can have your fireballs  your invisibility  your bark skin  but nothing really matches being able to heal yourself from damage if you plan on getting hit then restoration is your good friend more or less your  holy builds  have this as a secondary school because of its ability to fuck up zombies spells like turn undead can have the ability to not only make the spirits of the damned run away peeing their pants but also sets them on fire because fuck it that s what good guys do it also has a proper magic defense system as well in the form of wards even a low level steadfast ward spell can have total protection against dragon breath  if you need something to complement your  main  school you can never go wrong with restoration it is a perfectly valid school of magic  6   enchanting  special    probably the most potentially broken  magic school   this basically makes the game easier than your mom on prom night making full suits of daedric armor overflowing with health and magicka and making spells have zero cost speaks for itself you probably wo nt need to bother with builds at this point  now  these can be used in any

536,537,the elder scrolls vi  alinor takes place on the summerset isle a few years after skyrim the main city of focus would be alinor under the third aldmeri dominion s control  there would be a few factions to join  the aldmeri dominion s army the altmer pantheon s religious body the psijic order the aldmeri dominion s version of the mage s guild the aldmeri dominion s version of the fighter s guild an aldmeri dominion spy and assassin guild  reminiscent of the blades or the morag tong  the game would start you off on a boat reaching the summerset isle  perhaps you were a dissenter of the thalmor or a talos worshiper the ship would crash off the northwestern coast of the isle near lillandril or alinor  the altmer s version of the mage s guild would be orderly and extremely wellkept  considering their veneration of the magical arts the questline would be similar to that of the mage s guild in morrowindoblivion  the altmer s version of the fighter s guild  on the other hand  is decrepit and the questline would be about raising it from the ground and helping it become stronger than the other magical related guilds  the aldmeri dominion s army would be joinable  and would be all about rooting out talos worhsip and aldmeri dissenters within the isle racism would be highly present in the army  only the altmer themselves spared from the scorn of their superiors and of their colleagues an example quest would be this  a man was reported for having an undesirable opinion about the third aldmeri dominion  and it would be your job to carry out his arrest and interrogation  the aldmeri dominion s version of the blades or the morag tong would be all about assassinating talos worshipers and dissenters and quieting public knowledge of the outside world s view on the altmer and their government  the psijic order would play a part as a joinable faction and a part of the main quest they are steeped in mystery and are the next step for a mage beyond the dominion s sanctioned guild  the altmer s pantheon would be joinable  helping to convert outsiders to the altmer pantheon  etc  the main quest would be about the eye of magnus and the untapped power that was discussed lightly in skyrim the main quest begins with rumors of the psijic s return  and you have to seek them out based on clues you get on the boat you originally crashed on the isle on  plus the local rumors upon finding the psijic order  you ll do some grunt work and work your way up the ranks  eventually you ll get attacked by the aldmeri dominion and you ll hear about how the eye of magnus was stolen  and how the dominion recently acquired a powerful artifact from across the sea  that artifact being the staff of magnus  whoever would be leading the aldmeri dominion at that point in time would utilize the staff and eye to become a demigod  much like how the almsivi became gods  but through the eye of magnus instead the rest of the main quest would focus around the psijic s pursuit of recapturing the eye and putting and end to unrightful godhood ,d01gtdd,skyrim,gaming,1455592052,ElvishisnotTengwar,3,0,0,0,
537,538,the elder scrolls  elsweyr takes place in the homeland of the khajiit  during thalmor occupation  factionsquestlines  the moonlit eye  basically the blades and related to main questline  the thalmor bard s college ulfric s army  splinter of the stormcloaks  imperials fighters guild mages guild a rival mages guild that s basically house telvanni the night whispers  thieves guild  the good word  librarycultural center of the khajiit  the hist s children  argonian group  buisness center that sells underground skooma i ca nt think of any new features but i d like more development on romance questlines  and maybe fewer spouses    and you could buy a room  rather than having a house or nothing i like the idea of a dlc that takes place in summerset isles not even focusing on the thalmor  just getting to see the culture ,d01f1c7,skyrim,gaming,1455589251,Little-miss-hetalia,2,0,0,0,
538,539,it would take place in hammerfell or elsweyr not long after skyrim  allowing the player to rally tamriel s races against the aldmeri dominion and crush it as a twist on the series  tradition of starting as a prisonercaptive  the player could be a prison guard  or perhaps an executioner like ahtar  i would probably try to merge the faction quests with the main quest  with crossroads to make the player choose between 2  like joining tg  or  db  not both at the same time  instead of making them separate  linear faction questlines all joinable by the same character  ca nt think of anything else now ,d026wtn,skyrim,gaming,1455648780,besyuziki,1,0,0,0,
539,540,i would set it in either black marsh or hammerfell and go back to the morrowind formula of making a strange and wondrous world  as well as making the player largely feel at a disadvantage for a lot of it the player wo nt be some god in human flesh  at least not from the start they will have to build and work to it  i think i d also probably lean more toward static leveling  since i felt that it was rather rewarding when you managed to get to higher level dungeons and collect higher level loot  and tbh  i d prolly add in a lot of spell effects that were missing in skyrim  and mysticism would definitely get back in  i d try my best to get more weapon types like spears and halberds  furthermore  i d love to build on fallout 4 s crafting system  although less tiered and more varied i would love to add much more aesthetic influence  with different racial styles and being able to have  say  a khajiitistyle pommel on a nordic hilt with an argonianstyle blade  i d try and make the components all as viable as one another  too  as for plot and questlines  i think it s a given the games are leading up to a clash with the thalmor  so we re going to see a followup on that a reveal of their intentions  their desire to unravel the world by waking the godhead  so on and so forth i wan na get into much more esoteric stuff with the main quest and utilize a lot of lore that s not been used before  i d also love to have questlines be a bit more layered and have multiple ways of resolving them more in the morrowindstyle  where things can and probably will go wrong  and the journals account for things like npc death  faction questlines will prolly end up a bit more mundane  but have more content packed into them skyrim i always felt rewarded you too easily and you just ascended the ranks extremely fast so this time  you re going to have a bit more mundane experience at the beginning  but you re going to be interacting with guildmates more as a result radiant quests will probably still be around but a bit less  since i find a merit in handcrafted stuff handcrafted quests probably have less edging toward fetch quests  which were pretty damn rampant in skyrim  so i think overall  probably largely go back to an older way of doing things but revitalize the older concepts with a bit of the new  edit  oh and there s discussion earlier on voice actors i think i d definitely invest more in simply hiring way more voice actors or having the voice actors we already have doing more kinds of voices for different characters  rather than trying to get people like liam neeson or max von sydow to voice characters quality is important  but a diversity in voice is equally important when you have tons of npcs  hence  i would want to make as many npcs as i can feel unique  furthermore  i ve noticed a lot of npcs tend to have unique greetings  and what it results in is people blurting out their life story   i work for belethor at the general goods store  or the riverwood vendor thanking you for getting the golden claw every time you pass even after it s been months  when i actually feel simply recording a bunch of simple greetings would be better  though unique greetings would have a merit of their own and if i could  i d put them in as well  although a bit diminished  giving disposition a greater presence would also be a good idea and would factor into the greetings better  npcs would greet you less favorably if they do nt like youmore favorably if they do like you   i do nt think anyone wants a dialogue wheel again  but maybe putting in more unseen factors to increase or decrease disposition would be better even adding a ui indication in the spirit skyrim wanted to is possible  perhaps by having the dialogue menu or some element of it brighter with higher disposition and darker with lower disposition ,d02bii4,skyrim,gaming,1455654918,NeuroticNyx,1,0,0,0,

637,638,i finally decided to try a single life game on legendary after reading the excitement others found in the constant danger i made an altmer mage because i had nt played a mage in awhile i decided i d head to the college eventually  but would begin by heading toward falkreath  just for kicks after a pleasant sunset stroll along the lake  i stepped into the dead man s drink for a night s rest  as i innocently approached the counter  i passed a heavily armored orc who asked me what i was doing there  called me a milkdrinker  and told me to go back to my mother  all in one breath what did i do  i politely told him he should nt talk to me like that his reply  with a laugh   what are you going to do  cry   at this point i decided to walk away  for my own safety  to which he responded   you re so boring   and charged me with his sword drawn seriously mr orc  i filled his face with dualcasted flames and backpedaled in circles around the hearth  through the mob of ignorant bystanders he got a few hits on me when i ran backward into a pole or person  but i was actually holding my own i might not actually have to be permasliced into a heap on the floor of a bar within the first ten minutes  as i rounded a corner of the hearth  i clumsily sprayed my flame spell on one of the many taverngoers who apparently did nt think better than to simply stand in the midst of a charging orc and a mage burning a circular track in the floor  immediately everyone in the tavern drew their weapons  big and small  and turned on me  appalled at my aggression upon the innocent victim i was quickly permasliced into a heap on the floor of a bar with the first ten minutes  perhaps i ll try a  permadeathwiththreestrikes playthrough ,465qhw,skyrim,gaming,1455672082,splurgurnurk,3,0,1,0,0.0

1057,1058,i recommend levelling other magic styles conjuration is alot of fun  summoning spells are great bound weapons are handy as they count them as physical damage  handy for getting through wards  and level up weapon attacks bound weapons have perks to fill soul gems too soul trap will fill the soul gems you need for enchanting items  to level up enchanting  disenchant a bunch of things you do nt use when you have alot of enchantments  get items and enchant the shit out of everything soul gems are very expensive so this is where your conjuration spells become useful  smithing can be levelled up by making stuff buy or collect loads of leather and ore for ingots then just keep making things  for alchemy just keep making potions if you are impatient for levelling by doing the things  you can also just pay for lessons ghorza in markarth  eorland greymane in whiterun and riften s blacksmith are good for lessons in smithing ,d025940,skyrim,gaming,1455646541,jarris123,1,0,3423,1610,0.0
1059,1060,for enchanting  get a bunch of soul gems  empty ones   you ll find them constantly just keep saving them  as soon as you find an item with soul trap  disenchant it at an enchanting station  then acquire the best bow  unenchanted  that you can find  and a decentsized soul gem  greater should be fine  though lesser can work too  go to an enchanting station with the bow and a soul gem  select the bow  select  soul trap  from the enchant list and slide the slider all the way to the left  it should say  when the target dies in 1 second  fill a soul gem   name it something original like  soul trap bow  and then craft it  the reason you do the  1 second  thing is because it maximizes the number of charges on it now just roam around and shoot stuff with empty soul gems in your inventory  and you ll fill them up quickly  also  be sure to always check the disenchant menu before selling magic items  you only need to disenchant something once to unlock it  so it s typically better to do that than sell it  there are the  gloves of the pugilist  in the ratways of riften  these are the only source of  fortify unarmed  in the whole game  be sure to disenchant these  if you want to make the game more fun  and are playing on pc  get some mods that make the game mor erealistic i like  traps kill    realistic lightning    improved enemy ai   requires skse    skyui   better menus   a lighting improvement mod that makes everything far darker  you should not be able to see when the moon is not out and it s 12 am  or in the dark parts of a dungeon where there are no torches   even on legendary  though  when you get to be high enoug hlevel with good equipment  the game is still sorta easy  i can 1shot normal dragons with my bow if i crit them   ,d02dym0,skyrim,gaming,1455658172,armahillo,2,0,544,7459,0.0
1060,1061,i think at this point i ve tried out almost every viable build in the game  the most overpowered and funnest class i played in skyrim is easily shield and 1h  sword for me   it really only starts to get rolling after you get pretty high shield perks  but you can cheese your block up pretty easily by blocking something that hits hard  giants on low difficulty   and healing it up  this levels your restoration and your block and also easily transfers into leveling heavy armor your 1h skill perks do nt matter that much except for damage early if you really want to min max you have to do smithing and enchanting as well alchemy can be helpful too but its not needed to shield bash dragons into outer space  for how to level each of the skills that is up to you if you want to use a guide on the most efficient ways of doing so  but they re mostly pretty obvious ,d02gje2,skyrim,gaming,1455661673,vexxer209,1,0,1,11578,0.0
1062,1063,i ve been a huge fan of elder scrolls iv  oblivion i played that game like around 500 hours i was always kinda reserved when it went to approaching skyrim so i never really gave it a chance until recently  now after a couple of days i already got 20 hours playtime  i went for a more mage focused character and i m so bored  d but i m scared of starting over again and getting a boring character again the standard destruction mage is definitely not something for me  also how do i level up things like enchanting  alchemy and smithing  i really wan na play on a higher difficulty then the usual but i ll need things like potions  better armor and enchanted armor for that  i greatly appreciate any tip i get  ,462uay,skyrim,gaming,1455635618,Superf1cial,131,0,0,0,
1063,1064,imo the most fun way to level up smithing is to raid a dwarven ruin and collect all of the artifacts that you can melt down for scrap if you bring a follower with you  you can avoid going over carry weight by pointing things out for them to pick up  they ll never be overburdened that way   buy all the iron ingots you can and use them to create dwarven bows you get a decent amount of gold and it s fun  also  you can enchant the items before you sell to make even more money and level up enchanting also  other people here are right  you do nt need to start over to take your character in a different direction good luck ,d023ii5,skyrim,gaming,1455644161,wynautzoidberg2,2,0,0,0,
1065,1066,the way i bump up enchanting is to get the summon bow spell  then under the skill tree for it unlock the perk that fills a soul gem when you kill shit  i just go from there filling any soul gem i also steal a lot of refined ores from blacksmiths shops  they usually have a bundle under their work bench  and make shitty weapons  enchant  then sell  dump em ,d0273l1,skyrim,gaming,1455649028,Slimy_Shart_Socket,1,0,0,0,

1070,1071,i always liked playing as a ranger rogue  mostly because surprises in melee combat can scare me witless  but you might like it  as for those skills  i can recommend training smithing by buying leather stripsleather and make the strips yourself  and iron ingots and making iron daggers you need quite a lot for a high level  but it is the most efficient way smiths generally sell quite a bit of them and you can of course also buy iron ore and smelt it yourself ,d02h0h0,skyrim,gaming,1455662349,DPSOnly,1,0,0,0,

4362,4363,what you would call the game  whenwhere in tamriel that it would take place  a summary of it s plot and quest lines  any new features it would include  or perhaps what dlc you would want it to have ,45zpig,skyrim,gaming,1455581899,Slash_Raptor,11,0,8,1848,0.0
4364,4365,i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,d01bg2z,skyrim,gaming,1455583606,sloogz,8,0,337,4059,0.0

4552,4553,there is a variety of things you can try to improve your magic flailing madman in the fantastic land of skyrim  as you said you have gone through everything there is to be the wonderful wizard of skyrim so let s get a good look at the various schools of magic and see what might fit you  1   alteration   a class for a magician who just wants to feelwell magical  this school as you may know is based around defenses and miscellaneous utilities essentially your  buff  school being a mage is a squishy life unlike the heavy plated beserking monstrosity that are mighty orc  the wall  warrior builds  mages tend to be as well defended as a wet napkin this can be offset later on with enchanting which i will talk about later but that s the bitch way son spells like stoneflesh and dragonskin put some hair on your pale wizard chest and get you ready to rumble in the cold harsh world however alteration shines the greatest when its just doing utility jobs with its tools such as candlelight  transmute  detect life  telekinesis  and paralysis  alteration can work with any school but is more or less a passive school  2   conjuration   imagine this a dragon swoops down and starts causing a ruckus on your hometown of  insert home here  but you just ca nt be bothered to get your soft magic hands dirty well then conjuration is the class for you  this school of magic lets you summon your wageless demonic slaves or undead minions to combat problems for you even awaken your inner goodguymagicman and banish the creatures of oblivion back to the shadow realm from whence they came but if you re the sort of person who s day is nt complete without killing it yourself well then conjuration allows you to summon weapons and bows as well  a pro at this school can have their own undead army or personal daedric escort to help you and your merry magical adventures across the land of skyrim hell you can even steal the souls of the living to use in your horrible  or purely academic  mad experiments by trapping them in soul gems with soul trap as long as you can kill them before the spell ends depending on how you play  this school can be either very hands on or very laid back whether you d decide to get up and personal with hell itself or just let your army of the damn deal with it on your behalf it is a very fun school that can work very well with alteration if you refuse to dawn even the most fragile of armors and restoration if you find yourself getting more than a scratch  3   destruction   now here s a fucking school of magic if you want to be a master of the element  s  that throws balls of explosive fire  bone chilling spikes of ice  or motherfucking sith lightning  then this is the school for you you can either focus into a specific element or branch out and enjoy what destruction has to offer now by endgame  with the proper perks invested such as impact  overpowered  you can essentially have enemies constantly stagger as you launch volley after volley of whatever flamingfrozenshocking projectile you can fling at them until they are nothing but smears on the floor each branch of destruction has their benefits and drawbacks fire works mostly with overtime damage and directly focuses on taking down an enemies health but is somewhat weaker  frost is excellent at slowing an enemy to a crawl and preventing power attacks but can be fairly wonky to work with and does the least damage of the 3 shock does the most damage and is the magician s natural predator as it will beat that magicka bar like it caught it cheating but it takes a ton of magicka to use their spells and cost the most of the 3 each one is a different playstyle and ultimately falls under player preference this school works exceptionally well with restoration as you may be the more offensive kinda guy and it is an offensive kinda school  4   illusion   you ever feel like you want to be a sneaky manipulative piece of shit but ca nt be bothered to do any actual fighting  welcome to the palpatine school of being a manipulative asshole illusion works great if you want to be stealthy and out of the way spells like pacify  fear  frenzy  can make sure you do nt ever have to worry about an enemy again because they either ran away  killed each other  or simply lost the will to be bothered other spells like rally do the opposite and make your allies  better  faster  and stronger which makes this work really well with conjuration if you are simply too shy to deal with people at all then muffle and invisibility are the introverted wizard s best friend  this school is a very supportsecondary school you use on top of your combat or lack thereof as it takes full advantage of a situation given you have the proper training because of this  it can be a school that works well outside of the sphere of the mage that warriors  thiefs  assassins and shifty pedophiles take complete advantage of the possibilities are endless  5   restoration   this is possibly the most essential school that a mage could invest in you can have your fireballs  your invisibility  your bark skin  but nothing really matches being able to heal yourself from damage if you plan on getting hit then restoration is your good friend more or less your  holy builds  have this as a secondary school because of its ability to fuck up zombies spells like turn undead can have the ability to not only make the spirits of the damned run away peeing their pants but also sets them on fire because fuck it that s what good guys do it also has a proper magic defense system as well in the form of wards even a low level steadfast ward spell can have total protection against dragon breath  if you need something to complement your  main  school you can never go wrong with restoration it is a perfectly valid school of magic  6   enchanting  special    probably the most potentially broken  magic school   this basically makes the game easier than your mom on prom night making full suits of daedric armor overflowing with health and magicka and making spells have zero cost speaks for itself you probably wo nt need to bother with builds at this point  now  these can be used in any combination of ways such as destructive conjurer  holy gandalf build batman   alterationrestorationconjuration   manipulative priest  illusionrestoration   pure conjurer  conjuration   pure destruction mage  destruction   sneak archer etc etc  in the end there is nt really any particular way to play a mage if none of the many combinations suit you or you simply are not having fun then magic might not be for you ,d01krkg,skyrim,gaming,1455598735,Loremaster_Wuyo,5,0,3965,20668,0.0

4815,4816,oh man  i ll give you the run down on how to level quick and make a lot of gold in the process you ll need to delve into dungeons to get started as well as keep this going  so you should nt get too bored  first and foremost  some rules  1  whenever you see any weapon or armor or ring that is enchanted  pocket it and disenchant it at an altar so you can enchant other weapons with its effects  2  grab all soul gems you see  3  any iron  silver or gold oreingot pocket it as well 4  do nt buy anything except ingots and ores they are sold at blacksmiths whiterun is ideal because there are 3 people you can buy from  first  you ll want to go north of whiterun to halted stream camp there is a ton of iron mines there  and an awesome spell called transmute this take iron ore and turns it into silvergold ore this makes your smithing increase more than iron would do  buy as much iron ingot and ore and make iron daggers and jewelry and then sell them off  a huge thing here that will change both your money and leveling drastically is to find a weapon that has soul trap on it  disenchant it and then use a soul gem to enchant a bowcrossbow with soul trap  since you likely are low level you ll only encounter petty and lesser soul gems fill these by walking around the whiterun plains and killing deer  mudcrabs  etc with your bow  now that you have a lot of filled soul gems  go make some daggers and jewelry  and then enchant them all with whatever enchantment and then sell them this will get you quite a bit of money  all while leveling enchanting and smithing you can now afford even more iron ingot to make more daggers to rinse and repeat  if you have the dawn guard expansion  the soul cairn is full of soul gems ripe for the taking if you are running low on them just go and restock  after you ve leveled your smithing a bit you ll want to unlock the dwarven smithing dwarven ingot is by far the most common and easy to stockpile in the game they are all found in dwarven ruins  and dwarven ingot can be smelted from many dwarven scrap metal you find lying around there  make dwarven bows  enchant  sell  some other tips  you can level conjuration easily by finding a mud crab and just recasting a summon spell like  conjure sword   it levels very fast the reason being is that you must be in combat to level conjuration  and the summon sword spell wo nt kill the mudcrab as long as you do nt attack it  also  you do nt need to specialize in skyrim  you can really do anything g with any character you want to focus on health and magic for your character  i d say your stamina should never go above 200 points unless you are very high level  the solitude blacksmith also has a ton of iron  steel  and silver ingot for you to loot just do nt get caught ,d023j98,skyrim,gaming,1455644191,hks9,10,0,94,17344,0.0

10953,10954,i would put the next elder scrolls in the merethic era  in skyrim again this would be during the dragon war  which would serve as the main quest the finale of the main quest would be banishing alduin at the throat of the world as you see in skyrim   minor factions the player could join include  dragon priests  this seems counterintuitive to the main quest and destroying the dragons  but hear me out  the dragon priests you would join would worship a sect of dragons aside from alduin s reign that seek to destroy him  as you do   ysgramor s original companions jurgen windcaller s early greybeards morag tong akaviri warriors  early blades  generic bard s college mage s guild dwemer craftsmantype school snow elf knightpaladin s guild  auriel s chantry  nordic rebellion against the empire  i m calling the  guild of roots  and some others  the game would start with you on a boat on your way to tamriel from atmora  with many of the other original settlers of skyrim on their way too uniquely  the race that you choose determines the way the game starts  nord  fight a dragon on the coast of skyrim imperial  hide in a nord migration boat and sneak your way out redguard  fight your way through a massive battle through the west border of skyrim any elf except snow elf  fight a group of nords trying to fight their way into skyrim any beastkind  a slow start living in your respective continent until you re kidnapped and brought to skyrim snow elf  yes  snow elf would be a playable race here   starting out as a snow elf slave to the dwemer  fighting a group of dwemer and dwemer constructs with fellow snow elves to escape from blackreach  the geography of skyrim would be mostly ancient nordic cities labyrinthian would serve as the whiterun for this game  the central city that seems to have everything the throat of the world and the reach plateau would largely be the only areas of land similar to tes  v  i thought of this while playing a twohanded heavy armor  righteous  type character  and realized that this game hugely favors an  evil  sneak assassin type character just compare the length of the thieves guilddb to the companions i want this game to favor the honorable  facefirst warrior  though a sneaky type character would still be viable  edit  so much of skyrim seems to be ruins from another time  worn down by the ages i often think to myself when playing   what would skyrim be like back when all of this happened   i want the next elder scrolls to be that way it just so happens that all the cool shit that happens in skyrim is all in one era  making it ideal for a game everyone loved skyrim  so why move the game to another part of tamriel  this type of game would also fill in a huge gap lorewise as to what we know about skyrim as a whole  edit 2  i would include a new school of magic called  devotion   since conjuration is daedric magic  why not have original aedric magic  too  it would sort of be a mix of all of the existing schools of magic  with each of the divines having their own spells that you can cast ,d01bg2z,skyrim,gaming,1455583606,sloogz,9,0,337,4059,0.0

19503,19504,oh man  i ll give you the run down on how to level quick and make a lot of gold in the process you ll need to delve into dungeons to get started as well as keep this going  so you should nt get too bored  first and foremost  some rules  1  whenever you see any weapon or armor or ring that is enchanted  pocket it and disenchant it at an altar so you can enchant other weapons with its effects  2  grab all soul gems you see  3  any iron  silver or gold oreingot pocket it as well 4  do nt buy anything except ingots and ores they are sold at blacksmiths whiterun is ideal because there are 3 people you can buy from  first  you ll want to go north of whiterun to halted stream camp there is a ton of iron mines there  and an awesome spell called transmute this take iron ore and turns it into silvergold ore this makes your smithing increase more than iron would do  buy as much iron ingot and ore and make iron daggers and jewelry and then sell them off  a huge thing here that will change both your money and leveling drastically is to find a weapon that has soul trap on it  disenchant it and then use a soul gem to enchant a bowcrossbow with soul trap  since you likely are low level you ll only encounter petty and lesser soul gems fill these by walking around the whiterun plains and killing deer  mudcrabs  etc with your bow  now that you have a lot of filled soul gems  go make some daggers and jewelry  and then enchant them all with whatever enchantment and then sell them this will get you quite a bit of money  all while leveling enchanting and smithing you can now afford even more iron ingot to make more daggers to rinse and repeat  if you have the dawn guard expansion  the soul cairn is full of soul gems ripe for the taking if you are running low on them just go and restock  after you ve leveled your smithing a bit you ll want to unlock the dwarven smithing dwarven ingot is by far the most common and easy to stockpile in the game they are all found in dwarven ruins  and dwarven ingot can be smelted from many dwarven scrap metal you find lying around there  make dwarven bows  enchant  sell  some other tips  you can level conjuration easily by finding a mud crab and just recasting a summon spell like  conjure sword   it levels very fast the reason being is that you must be in combat to level conjuration  and the summon sword spell wo nt kill the mudcrab as long as you do nt attack it  also  you do nt need to specialize in skyrim  you can really do anything g with any character you want to focus on health and magic for your character  i d say your stamina should never go above 200 points unless you are very high level  the solitude blacksmith also has a ton of iron  steel  and silver ingot for you to loot just do nt get caught ,d023j98,skyrim,gaming,1455644191,hks9,12,0,94,17344,0.0

19505,19506,try mixing things up with conjuration  restoration and alteration makes a mage build far more fun  smithing is easy just buy a bunch of leather and leather strips from a shop and then skip two days ahead using the time changer function  which should restock the materials  and do it over and over til you reach 100  for enchanting  mine a bunch of ore  smelt them  craft a bunch of jewelry  which could help with levelling smithing as well if you have nt fully completed levelling it  and then go to dawnstar  find the dawnstar chest  it s near a mining cave iirc watch a video on the dawnstar chest glitch since it s too well hidden to accurately pinpoint the location using text  which has a significant amount of soul gems and gold which you should loot  then go to the khaijit caravan  if they do nt show up  change the time until they do  right outside dawnstar  talk to atahbah and if her gold is at 1250 that means the chest reset  and if it is nt on 1250  just save your game  attack her  then load the save and her gold should reset to 1250 which means the chest has reset as well go back to the chest and then rince and repeat  alchemy takes a long time go to the es wiki  find all the recipes  and then get the ingredients via buying them or just finding them  you can find their locations in the wiki as well  and then create them until you reach 100 alchemy  ps  you have to complete the thieves guild mission regarding caravans to unlock atahbah as a fence try doing the enchanting thing when you progress a little further in the game ,d01yw22,skyrim,gaming,1455637503,KnightsofKnightobia,13,0,1,-7,0.0

20279,20280,there is a variety of things you can try to improve your magic flailing madman in the fantastic land of skyrim  as you said you have gone through everything there is to be the wonderful wizard of skyrim so let s get a good look at the various schools of magic and see what might fit you  1   alteration   a class for a magician who just wants to feelwell magical  this school as you may know is based around defenses and miscellaneous utilities essentially your  buff  school being a mage is a squishy life unlike the heavy plated beserking monstrosity that are mighty orc  the wall  warrior builds  mages tend to be as well defended as a wet napkin this can be offset later on with enchanting which i will talk about later but that s the bitch way son spells like stoneflesh and dragonskin put some hair on your pale wizard chest and get you ready to rumble in the cold harsh world however alteration shines the greatest when its just doing utility jobs with its tools such as candlelight  transmute  detect life  telekinesis  and paralysis  alteration can work with any school but is more or less a passive school  2   conjuration   imagine this a dragon swoops down and starts causing a ruckus on your hometown of  insert home here  but you just ca nt be bothered to get your soft magic hands dirty well then conjuration is the class for you  this school of magic lets you summon your wageless demonic slaves or undead minions to combat problems for you even awaken your inner goodguymagicman and banish the creatures of oblivion back to the shadow realm from whence they came but if you re the sort of person who s day is nt complete without killing it yourself well then conjuration allows you to summon weapons and bows as well  a pro at this school can have their own undead army or personal daedric escort to help you and your merry magical adventures across the land of skyrim hell you can even steal the souls of the living to use in your horrible  or purely academic  mad experiments by trapping them in soul gems with soul trap as long as you can kill them before the spell ends depending on how you play  this school can be either very hands on or very laid back whether you d decide to get up and personal with hell itself or just let your army of the damn deal with it on your behalf it is a very fun school that can work very well with alteration if you refuse to dawn even the most fragile of armors and restoration if you find yourself getting more than a scratch  3   destruction   now here s a fucking school of magic if you want to be a master of the element  s  that throws balls of explosive fire  bone chilling spikes of ice  or motherfucking sith lightning  then this is the school for you you can either focus into a specific element or branch out and enjoy what destruction has to offer now by endgame  with the proper perks invested such as impact  overpowered  you can essentially have enemies constantly stagger as you launch volley after volley of whatever flamingfrozenshocking projectile you can fling at them until they are nothing but smears on the floor each branch of destruction has their benefits and drawbacks fire works mostly with overtime damage and directly focuses on taking down an enemies health but is somewhat weaker  frost is excellent at slowing an enemy to a crawl and preventing power attacks but can be fairly wonky to work with and does the least damage of the 3 shock does the most damage and is the magician s natural predator as it will beat that magicka bar like it caught it cheating but it takes a ton of magicka to use their spells and cost the most of the 3 each one is a different playstyle and ultimately falls under player preference this school works exceptionally well with restoration as you may be the more offensive kinda guy and it is an offensive kinda school  4   illusion   you ever feel like you want to be a sneaky manipulative piece of shit but ca nt be bothered to do any actual fighting  welcome to the palpatine school of being a manipulative asshole illusion works great if you want to be stealthy and out of the way spells like pacify  fear  frenzy  can make sure you do nt ever have to worry about an enemy again because they either ran away  killed each other  or simply lost the will to be bothered other spells like rally do the opposite and make your allies  better  faster  and stronger which makes this work really well with conjuration if you are simply too shy to deal with people at all then muffle and invisibility are the introverted wizard s best friend  this school is a very supportsecondary school you use on top of your combat or lack thereof as it takes full advantage of a situation given you have the proper training because of this  it can be a school that works well outside of the sphere of the mage that warriors  thiefs  assassins and shifty pedophiles take complete advantage of the possibilities are endless  5   restoration   this is possibly the most essential school that a mage could invest in you can have your fireballs  your invisibility  your bark skin  but nothing really matches being able to heal yourself from damage if you plan on getting hit then restoration is your good friend more or less your  holy builds  have this as a secondary school because of its ability to fuck up zombies spells like turn undead can have the ability to not only make the spirits of the damned run away peeing their pants but also sets them on fire because fuck it that s what good guys do it also has a proper magic defense system as well in the form of wards even a low level steadfast ward spell can have total protection against dragon breath  if you need something to complement your  main  school you can never go wrong with restoration it is a perfectly valid school of magic  6   enchanting  special    probably the most potentially broken  magic school   this basically makes the game easier than your mom on prom night making full suits of daedric armor overflowing with health and magicka and making spells have zero cost speaks for itself you probably wo nt need to bother with builds at this point  now  these can be used in any combination of ways such as destructive conjurer  holy gandalf build batman   alterationrestorationconjuration   manipulative priest  illusionrestoration   pure conjurer  conjuration   pure destruction mage  destruction   sneak archer etc etc  in the end there is nt really any particular way to play a mage if none of the many combinations suit you or you simply are not having fun then magic might not be for you ,d01krkg,skyrim,gaming,1455598735,Loremaster_Wuyo,7,0,3965,20668,0.0
22302,22303,all of the vigilants that i ve encountered in skyrim have been limited to the use of a mace and spells from the restoration and alteration schools of magic  it begs the question  could they use  or more importantly why are they prevented from using   swords  bows  shields  sneaking  conjuration magic  bound weaponssummons   destruction magic  i have a reason for asking  role playing and fan fiction creation i m thinking of a former soldier  spellswordscout  recently becoming a devotee of stendarr he s on a pilgrimage to the hall of the vigilant in skyrim which is his first experience as a vigilant since he has knowledge and experience of all the things above  i m wondering if there is some deeply religious reason why he should nt be using them i can see the limitation on the conjuration tree  but i ca nt see the limits imposed on the others ,45x38a,skyrim,gaming,1455551815,p4ck3tl055,15,0,39,436,0.0

24251,24252,the concept of an illusion mage really speaks to me  however bethesda could ve done so much more with it then what they did  it s basically 4 basic spells that get stronger from novice to master and then master spells that are also the same except they get an area of effect and then you also get muffle and invisibility  so in my opinion you really only get 6 spells which  after a while  is very boring to play with  is there any mod that revamps the illusion spells ,45xzwc,skyrim,gaming,1455562255,Virark,3,0,160,508,0.0

32131,32132,i ve been a huge fan of elder scrolls iv  oblivion i played that game like around 500 hours i was always kinda reserved when it went to approaching skyrim so i never really gave it a chance until recently  now after a couple of days i already got 20 hours playtime  i went for a more mage focused character and i m so bored  d but i m scared of starting over again and getting a boring character again the standard destruction mage is definitely not something for me  also how do i level up things like enchanting  alchemy and smithing  i really wan na play on a higher difficulty then the usual but i ll need things like potions  better armor and enchanted armor for that  i greatly appreciate any tip i get  ,462uay,skyrim,gaming,1455635618,Superf1cial,133,0,145,904,0.0
32132,32133,you do nt need to worry too much if you do nt like a play style  just switch to whatever you want amp  start levelling that up instead keep your character as  unless you are playing on legendary difficulty  skyrim is quite forgiving if you switch styles ,d01yhuk,skyrim,gaming,1455636869,waffle247,81,0,1,6161,0.0
