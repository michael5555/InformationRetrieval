522,523,ha  even though i dispute quite a lot of the facts and stats quoted in this i take the point about generalising  how you can construct a narrative from effective rhetoric and picking the right facts and telling people what they want to hear basically also that there is another side to the story and it s good to get perspective of how western culture is viewed this bit is an example of the disingenuous  imo  use of stats gt  other than india and zimbabwe  the rest of the top 10 countries with the highest incidence of rape in the world are western  is sort of taking advantage of the different laws on various sexual crimes and understanding of them in the western world and much of the developing world  iirc when similar victim surveys of sexual and domestic violence  that may or may not be worthy of generalisation to a larger population  have been done they seem to show women in the developing world  including large parts of the muslim world  generally report a higher rate of sexual assault and domestic violence  and the ones i ve seen that include men suggest that this might be true of the rate of perpetration by women aswell but i think they could both have an element of truth to them  especially the depression and loneliness in  especially anglo saxon   western countries  though i m not sure this is related to sexual openness even if it is true   and i think that evidence from western countries about decreasing rates of sexual crime in the last 40 or so years of increasing sexual openness seems to contradict it  i think it is an interesting question whether people would accept higher rates of a crime for more sexual freedom and openness and some degree of public separation of the sexes andor restriction on taboo sexual practices etc  though it s not universal in muslim countries   i do think that poverty  endogamy  especially arranged marriages who s aim is to preserve family assets  and polygamy are correlated with a large surplus of single men who can not marry  this is true of western countries with relative poverty and negligable endogamypolygamy etc  and have no public sexual outlet which is nt taboo  strained and fraught relationships between the sexes and a greater number of marriages where romantic love is secondary to being partners but i do remember some stuff suggesting that the separation of the sexes  of public and private and dress codes etc might produce stronger more intense relationships between couples the surplus  of young men is associated with social turmoil and upheaval  the conservative attitude to sex in public  which you could see in the chief objection that sex is everywhere   which is common in lots of places in the developing world  seems to just push things under the rug there are many of the same things as this person decries in the west going on in conservative countries  drug use  pre marital sex  homosexual sex  even though they do nt mention it  but they are in the shadows with people finding their own way and often not practising safe sex etc  in much of western culture in the last century or so is those cultures coming out into the mainstream ,d02affr,truereddit,news,1455653498.0,lurker093287h,1.0,0.0,5081,57519,0.0

694,695,as someone whose own 10th anniversary is in 2 weeks  this essay has got me feeling some type of way  i think her definition of romance as living in a cloud of suspense and question marks is the best definition i ve ever read her idea that in a longterm relationship  death supplies the suspense that romance used to  is really affecting  meaning it s both a bit sweet and a bit horrifying   i m not sure i agree that mute  tedious cosurvival is  the summit   she also claims  don  t let anyone tell you that living and dying together is some sad dance of codependent resignation   yet it sounds like that s exactly what she s defining longterm romance as there does nt seem to be any room for joy in her definition of romance i do realize she s being hyperbolic for the sake of humor  but what s intended to be funny and sweet comes off a little depressing  not a criticism as i think it opens an interesting discussion  only saying i m not sure that was the original intent  i also feel like one partner waking up one day and realizing  maybe there s more than this jaded  resigned  exhausting bullshit  is how midlife crises happen it s extremely immature to go from  i m unhappy with this quotidian slog  to  i must chase my adolescent notions of romance and adventure at all costs   but it happens anyway surely there s some middle way at our best i like to think my wife and i have itan adventurous slog  cosurvival against the tide of filth and gore  punctuated by occasional thrilling surprises  ruts happen too  and i feel like the author s recommending to redefine the rut and delude yourself that it s romance as a coping mechanism  i do nt know  i admit i m thinking out loud here good article  op  it s really got me thinking  which i suppose is the point of rtruereddit after all  ,czzs8qv,truereddit,news,1455475586.0,ThrowAwayYouDontSay,2.0,0.0,1,2062,0.0

762,763,there are lots of factors at stake  and predatory colleges  particularly nonaccredited trade or online schools built to soak up your federal loan money  are a problem i think the biggest factor  however  is a lack of bluecollar jobs it used to be that getting a college degree was not strictly necessary for the average person to do well  much less get by getting a college degree  therefore  almost guaranteed that you would do well with the loss of jobs which did not require an education  you have a flood of people who are still trying to make good on the promise that education  success but like any market  it is now saturated  so it becomes less true  i do nt know what the answers are but i do nt like most of those given usually it s  everyone should just study science or programming  that s a shortterm solution that will only flood those disciplines in a similar way  though there are social benefits to a more scientific society   it also risks further turning education into employeetraining instead of making engaged citizens and imaginative entrepreneurs  anyway  i m just tired of hating on college education it s not the education  per se  that is the problem but a larger social and economic trend that s been in motion for a few decades now ,d01xb97,truereddit,news,1455634874.0,Dicknosed_Shitlicker,5.0,0.0,2129,15312,0.0

1153,1154,so it s important to note that einstein did not come up through the university system he worked odd jobs  including as a patent clerk  that supported his lifestyle while giving him time to think deep thoughts he was not part of the university system until he had gained some fame for his work in fact  he became part of the university system because  while he had the conceptual ideas  he had to enlist help from mathematicians to develop the mathematical concepts to make his ideas predictive  there is no new einstein because 1  there are no einsteins left  the one we had has passed away some time ago  and 2  new questions in physics have nt revealed themselves yet the university system is a useful indoctrination of sorts it teaches kids to think and explore  but only from a rearward perspective even graduate school is a study in incrementalism and that is extremely important  ideas need incubation and deep thought from many minds to become useful but revolutionary ideas do not  in general  come up through the university system ,czzsuaq,truereddit,news,1455476593.0,brierrat,21.0,0.0,1,3821,0.0

6507,6508,oliver  like stewart before him  claims his show is purely comedy i think purely to dodge any serious criticism of the fact that it s quite opinionated there s no denying their shows have had an impact on various societalpolitical discussions  you can call it whatever the hell you want it does nt change what it is  not to mention oliver s show is frequently not about being funny  but rather bringing an issue to light i do nt know how anyone could be convinced that he chooses to discuss some social injustice in the last 15 minutes of every episode purely for the shits and giggles it s very obviously societalpolitical commentary with journalistic tendencies perhaps a bit too editorialized and comedic to qualify as traditional journalism  but i think that s practically nonexistent today anyway  anyway  the reason oliver says this is the same reason stewart did about the daily show any time they come under fire from others who blame them of distorting the facts or offering a one sided view they just deflect by saying they re comedy shows not meant to be taken seriously that s fine i guess  though i d be surprised if they were fooling anyone ,czyacin,truereddit,news,1455349133.0,interestme1,42.0,0.0,262,2032,0.0
