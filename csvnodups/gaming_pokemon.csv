9,10,it really is nt a feature i miss  but a gameplay aspect i m starting to notice  i miss how gym leaders could use a different number of pok  mon ever since black and white came out  the first two gym leaders use 2 pok  mon while the rest of them use 3 the other regions had some variety  in kanto for example  brock and misty use 2  lt surge uses 3 or 1 depending on the version  erika  sabrina  and blaine use 3  koga uses 4  and giovanni uses 5   elite four using 4 pok  mon is also something i do nt like i know oras is nt guilty of this but i think z will  i also miss the level variations the gym leaders  elite four  champion  and other bosses had i m sure many have noticed how the lead pok  mon is at the same level as every other pok  mon that the boss uses except for the ace  the lead pok  mon is always 2 levels less than the ace   it s just making the games a bit more predictable ,d02tp1u,pokemon,gaming,1455682211.0,Zero_Millennium,1.0,0.0,8,1909,0.0

26,27,i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,d02ske1,pokemon,gaming,1455680278.0,darkfrozzy,5.0,0.0,13,1669,0.0
27,28,so the one thing that s stopped me from going all the way with completing a national pokedex is that when a new generation is released  it s back to square one  sure you can use pokemon bank to transfers mons across  but this is time consuming and in order to maintain a complete dex you ll still need to be in possession of every evolution stage  what do you guys think about having the option to transfer pokedex completion to the next game  what would be some possible implications  restrictions etc to make it fair  do you think it s a bad idea in general  if so why ,466auu,pokemon,gaming,1455679785.0,Moloch86,2.0,0.0,103,2599,0.0

338,339,since i got my start when the game first released  i originally stopped playing when ruby and sapphire were announced at that point  i was approaching high school and various factors kicked in  i focused more on other games  video games  tcgs   pokemon had a stigma attached to it  i did nt have a gba  and was nt really looking to get one at the time   and  obviously  schoolrelated activities became more commonplace but  one of the big factors was that  after having played a sequel to the original games in gsc  i was disappointed to go somewhere new with no connections to the previous games and have very few returning pokemon  i wanted to pick the series back up when frlg came out  but i did nt have the funds to buy it or a gba i remember being intrigued by diamond and pearl  but  again  not excited enough to jump back into the fold once hgss were announced  and i was in college   i pounced back in as gsc had been my favorites for a long time by that point i did skip gen v on release because  as like with ruby and sapphire  the  reboot  aspect kinda rubbed me the wrong way  but the story in gen v is arguably the best in the main series  i again picked the series back up with xy riding the hype of 3d and the fact that a lot of people were diving back in to the series  but i found it lackluster  and it was nt for the fact that i had wanted to play through hoenn and did nt want to go back to the prephysicalspecial split era to do it  i might not have picked up oras the next game s announcement  features  etc are going to make or break whether i continue with the series again or not  i m just so burned out of doing the same things over and over and over again with the series and being  bored  while doing it if there was a fromthestartofthegame difficulty selection  as there  should  be   having to slog through the same overall plot outline each time might be more bearable to me ,d026z4s,pokemon,gaming,1455648864.0,Grefyrvos,0.0,0.0,0,0,

682,683, link to the pokemon center online shop   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  so now that the pokemon center online shop in japan has opened  i think that we all want to go bananas with our money so as someone who lives in japan and knows japanese  i would like give everyone some simple information about it  now first of all  the shop contains all of the current products that are available in the physical pokemon center shops  excluding shop exclusive items   but in return  the online pokemon center has some limited goods of its own    1 shipping   the shipping   japan only   cost 540   jpy  for orders that are under 5000   orders over 5000  are free  the boxes comes in  custom pokemon cardboard boxes   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialbox6290   it is also possible to choose gift wrapping if you pay an aditionall fee the shipping time is estimated to be 27 days    2 limited goods   there are several goods limited to the pokemon online center  including the extremely nice  kanto gym badge set   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialakamidori2154   there are also ongoing campains  where if you use more than 5000   you will get a random  1 out of 3 filefolder   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecomstaticimagespecialakamidori2154box02_bkpng   the next campaign  lasting from 19th of march  to 22nd of april  will have a similar system but instead of filesfolders  you will get a random  1 out of 3 mug cup   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecomstaticimagespecialpikachu2918paragraph03png  for those who shop at the online shop for the first time  will recieve a pikachu with fly and surf as moves the campaign will last until 22nd of may  and the serial code will be valid until 31st of august also  the code is only usable on japanese games  thanks umirukushake     3  point system   https  wwwpokemoncenteronlinecom  s  specialpokepoint8124    now the point system is where stuff gets interesting  1  of what you paid will become something called pokepoints  meaning that 10 000  would be 100 pokepoints   those points can later be used to play minigames if you would win in the minigames  you win special goods now it is unspecified about what kind of minigames and what kind of goods one are able to win for the time being so we just have to wait for more information    4 account and how to buy   if you want to buy something from the website  you have to make an account for the website this is the tricky part  because to be able to make an account  you have to have a japanese adress and phone number on top of that  as mentioned before  it only ships inside japan  so how do you buy  you ask  if you dont have japanese friends or family  your best go to option would be to use a website called  tenso   http  wwwtensocomen   so what happens is that you set your shipping adress to tenso in japan so that they get the items they will then send the products to your home  personally  i have never used tenso  seeing as i have no need for it but i ve heard good stuff about the service from a close friend that uses it alot to shop on the japanese amazon  other than that  if you just want to browse  i ve made a  small translation on the search engine found on the website   http  imgurcomewpjhvu   if there is something i forgot or something you were wondering about  please ask  and i will answer as fast as i can ,460kv1,pokemon,gaming,1455593917.0,AsianMixMaster,38.0,0.0,1737,1010,0.0

947,948,do you think there is a regional pokedex which can be completed without help from a guide  starting with gen ii  in generation i  i think you could complete the pokedex without any walkthrough  various people in the game told you clues about evolutionary stones  evolution by trade  and the legenday pokemons where in places you were naturally led to explore the rarest pokemons were the safari ones i think  but with a little patience you could catch them the legit way  but starting with generation ii  some evolution methods were impossible to guess  held items while trading  happiness  albeit you could max this one without knowing about it  just by levelingup   so i think a walkthrough may be compulsory to complete the jotoh pokedex  generation iii is yet again a step in the cryptic direction  unless you re lucky  there s no getting a shedinja without outside help the 6tilesfeebas is yet another  walkthroughalmostcompulsory  moment  not mentioning his convoluted evolution method and finally  i do nt think there s any trainer in the game using a chimecho  making it impossible to locate with the pokedex perhaps the regiriddle can be solved by a determined player  ca nt say myself as i was using a guide back then  right now i m finally playing gen iv  and i ve advanced the sinnoh pokedex as much as i can all alone  because i love discovering things by myself  but i fear i might soon have to search for answers on internet  as i m having difficulties with quite a number of pokemons  so i was wondering  is it even possible to complete a regional pokedex without a kind of guide  trading is authorized for evolution and versionexclusive pokemons purposes only has any of you been stubborn enough to complete a regional pokedex by yourself  without external help  mythical pokemons are out of the equation  because they are not needed to get the diploma ,d02kivl,pokemon,gaming,1455667785.0,jopopoe,1.0,0.0,1,0,0.0

1702,1703,i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,d02ske1,pokemon,gaming,1455680278.0,darkfrozzy,3.0,0.0,13,1669,0.0

7567,7568,i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there ,d02ske1,pokemon,gaming,1455680278.0,darkfrozzy,4.0,0.0,13,1669,0.0
