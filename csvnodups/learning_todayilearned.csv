1171,hmmm this is a tough nut to crack i m going to end up skewing the numbers in the favor of safety as i do nt have the time or inclination to do all of the research  but i ll give this the best go i can in a short amount of time    in 2014  one of the worst years on modern record for navy pilots  there were 48 incidents  from minor malfunctions to scenarios resulting in death  per 100000 flight hours   the blue angels practice 55 minutes twice a week without accounting for off weeks  that amounts to about 95 hours a year the blue angels came into existence in 1946  70 years ago   i m assuming there s been a pretty big variance in their practice schedules over the years  but for the sake of consistency we ll use modern numbers that means that  per pilot  there have been 6650 hours of practice time over the course of the program s history  the blue angles have 33 shows scheduled this year  we ll assume an hour for each show  and for the sake of easy math  we ll assume this is a pretty usual year over the course of the group s 70year history we ll also assume 1 hour shows each that means that we can add another 2310 hours per pilot in show time over the course of history  giving a perpilot total of 8960 hours flight time over 70 years  there are currently 16 blue angels again  this seems likely to be a larger number than in the beginning of the group  but since we re already skewing our numbers high  why not keep it that way  if there have been 16 pilots total over 70 years  that means we can calculate a round total of 143360 flight hours over the course of the program s history   this gives us a total blue angel fatality ratio of about 18 incidents per 100000 flight hours   compared to 48 incidents  including everything else that could possibly go wrong  up to and including fatalities  per 100000 hours for regular navy pilots    tl  dr  being a blue angel is astonishingly more dangerous than being a regular navy pilot shoutout to rtheydidtheshittymath

selfadmission that my math is likely horribly inaccurate  for a number of different reasons  the errors yall have pointed out so far   ujust_another_masshol points out that there are only 10  blue angels  each year  and only 7 of these fly the planes we all think of when we picture them in our minds   ujust_another_masshol also pointed out that the team practices quite a bit more often in the offseason  though how much more often  and to what extent that might affect our numbers  we re not entirely sure   uexelion pointed out that there was at least 1 year where they did nt perform at all  so where does this leave us    my numbers likely underestimate the danger to blue angel pilots over the course of their history  however   the last fatal blue angel incident was in 2007  and is the only fatality in the group in the past 15 years   https  enwikipediaorgwikiblue_angels  accidents    like anything in life  i d take what i give you with a grain of salt    edit 4   you re a persistent bunch  reddit it s time for another lesson in shitty math  given everything we ve learned  we re going to make a few different assumptions in this exercise  in an attempt to get to a better answer   there have been 262 blue angels over the course of the team s 70year history this means an average of about 4 blue angelsyear  26270  374  so we ll round up    the blue angels practice about 2 hours a week during the season  which i ll assume is about 33 weeks a year  as it appears to be this year   this is an average of 66 hourspilotyear   the blue angels practice 2 hoursday in the offseason  which is the remaining 19 weeks a year this is 266 hourspilotyear  which  when added to their inseason practice  gives us a running total of 332 hourspilotyear   we ll assume that they average 3 hours of flying between shows and back at 33 shows a year  and six hours worth or roundtrip flying  we can add another 198 hoursyear to the running total per pilot  bringing us to 530 hoursyear   each show itself is about an hour long  so we ll tack on another 33 hours of flight time we re now at 563 hourspilotyear   we ll pad our numbers by another 100 hours of miscellaneous flight time per pilot per year  for things like additional training  additional time between shows  and extra practice and qualification flights that gets us to 663 hourspilotyear  that means that  on average over the course of their history  the team has put in about 2652 flight hoursyear  663x4  2652  and a total of 185640 hours over the course of their history  2652x70     this works out to be a fatality incidence of almost exactly 14 per 100000 flight hours     26185640  x100000  140056   this is slightly  lower  than our initial numbers  but still orders of magnitude larger than what a regular navy pilot faced in 2014  less than 48 incidents per 100000 flight hours   so where does this leave us  nowhere in particular  really there are likely a large number of factors i have nt taken into account  and my numbers are  still  likely off and that s assuming i did the math right remember  i studied journalism  so the odds against it are actually fairly large    tl  dr i have no idea anymore  but the preponderance of the evidence at hand indicates that being a stunt pilot is way more dangerous than being a nonstunt pilot

1328,this coach has been doing it for years and this has been discussed for years all of these strategies are based on not focusing too much on a single play or drive  but focusing on maximizing points overall in the long run statheads understand it  but football coaches are terrified of that mindset  the 2 point conversion over pat strategy is very simple to understand a high school kicker is nt going to kick close to 100  on pats but high school defenses are nt very good so you re going to convert more than 50  of 2 point conversion attempts you get more points in the long run by always going for 2  never punting is very popular amongst madden players because video game football tends to be more high scoring  like high school  and having 4 plays to get 10 yards as opposed to 3 plays is a massive advantage if you fail to convert  you re going to lose more field position than if you punted  but in high scoring games  field position is nt as important as sustaining drives and keeping the ball away from your opponent  this is part of the reason why teams that lose all game can suddenly drive the ball in the last few minutes of games and come from behind  because they re willing to go for it on 4th down in those scenarios and gain that extra play  not to mention that defenses play soft in these scenarios which is really stupid  but most coaches do it   the onside kick strategy is the one that throws people for a loop onside kicks fail most of the time why do something that is destined to fail most of the time  what happens when it fails  you lose some field position in high school the field position difference is nt as much because these high school kickers are nt getting touchbacks you may lose 2025 yards of field position on a failed onside  but a successful onside gives you an extra possession while taking one away from your opponent  again  in high scoring high school football when your opponent may score most drives regardless of field position  gaining those extra possessions is huge  when all you do is onside kicks all year  your kicker gets tons of practice at them  and you ll convert them more than if you only use them in desperation once or twice a year  these strategies absolutely make sense in high school  punting less and always going for 2 might make sense in college  in the nfl  you should punt less but these extremes likely would nt work in the nfl when you have good kickers  but field position matters more and defenses are much better ,d02s1td,todayilearned,learning,1455679420.0,enderandrew42,1.0,0.0,3565,126905,0.0

2657,a link between high intelligence and mental disorders may be the case  but i think there are some problems with statements like this  jamison said that creativity appears to be significantly linked to mood disorders  especially bipolar disorder for instance  one 2010 study that tested the intelligence of 700000 swedish 16yearolds found that highly intelligent adolescents were more likely to develop bipolar disorder in a decadelong followup  16year olds that get a bipolar diagnosis are also more likely to be in a higher socio economic class than those that dont the troubled ones who belong to a lower socioeconomic class are more likely to show up on other statistics like youth delinquencies and drug abuse i think this is an issue of socioeconomic status rather than a connection between mental disorders and intelligence ,d01pd63,todayilearned,learning,1455610481.0,bobtheshrimp,26.0,0.0,1,25,0.0
