915,916,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but ,d00uue2,news,news,1455558861.0,cl3ophatra,189.0,0.0,1539,1458,0.0

1105,1106,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber ,d02r8j0,news,news,1455678088.0,americanpegasus,12.0,0.0,20104,47049,1.0

2224,2225,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system ,d01psph,news,news,1455612030.0,mrcharles2,9.0,0.0,918,40191,0.0

19329,19330,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits ,d029obu,news,news,1455652491.0,Excelius,14.0,0.0,249,6571,1.0

19361,19362,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar ,d029y6j,news,news,1455652853.0,iMolest,21.0,0.0,0,0,

39234,39235,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system ,d01psph,news,news,1455612030.0,mrcharles2,8.0,0.0,918,40191,0.0
