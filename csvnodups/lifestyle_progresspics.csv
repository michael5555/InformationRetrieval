7,8, before amp  after   http  mimgurcomaigytu  i posted in rloseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone s stories about being healthy and losing weight  mine basically started with the fact that i have depression which is something that i ve always had to deal with and always will but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca nt change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i m overweight  i hated how i could nt fit into any stylish clothes  just sweats and 2xl tshirts from walmart i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could nt fit into anymore i hated how i could nt go outside one of those pics i m in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that s not a very healthy way to live life  around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would nt miss for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go and then i cut out alcohol within the first month i lost 2530 pounds right there then i cut out red meat  which did wonders for my energy i also started walking everywhere workschoolshopping  and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs  you get the picture after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing  kick boxing and jiu jitsu i ve always loved mma and it s amazing what all of those  boxing especially  did for my muscle and weight loss really toned up my shoulders as well  i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do nt notice it and it s so good for you  just baby steps losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on   these are all pics of me throughout 2014 when i was at my heaviest  302 lbs    http  imgurcomanoeop   this is me as of last weekend   http  imgurcomamloql ,460os0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455595523,JMueller2012,75,0,23973,38032,0.0

108,109,i m 25lbs down  169 this morning    and still have another 15 to go  aiming for 155 i m enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body  from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal htwt should i knew that would mean slower progress  but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time  which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later when i first started midseptember  i used mfp religiously at this point i do nt use it very often  and instead keep a loose running total in my head  and monitoring my activity with my fitbit i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet  or when i forget the specifics of a certain food i ve found that strict calorie counting  using mfp  for instance  has tradeoffs for me i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably  which is great but  i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every daymostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life i think for some people it s quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it  for me it feels the opposite  like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger  more defining part of me than i m comfortable with so  i ve decided i m ok not doing it all the time  but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing  in terms of changes i ve made to eatinglifestyle  1 keto since midseptember  this has definitely changed my body s needscravings for food  and how i view food i still love the experience of food  but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy it s fuel  and also social  and also an experience  but mostly fuel   since about middecember i ve started doing intermittent fasting  if   though i do it more loosely than some do i usually have a fatty breakfast  2 eggs  a creditcard sized filet of salmon  half an avocado  and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream   then i eat nothing but coffee with creamhalf and half until dinner  which is usually around 68pm i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i m eating lots of carbs my blood sugar is level  so while some days i ll notice the absence of food  most days i do nt   started c25k in december   more generally  i m more purposeful in exercise i was already exercising a fair bit  36 halfhour walks a day with the dog  plus rock climbing during the week   in early december i got a fitbit  and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise i ve tried to just up my exercise slowly now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks  3 halfhour runs in the neighborhood  c25k has been great    and 2 hourlong rock climbing workouts at the gym since the beginning of january i ve also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts i use it for lower body  arms  and abs  slowly increasing how much time i do each for example right now i can do about 1056 minutes each on those using that app i recommend it  though it has some clunky parts  so yeah  25lbs down  15 to goi m excited to have passed a new decade on the scale  and i ve found this community very helpful and inspiring thanks for letting me lurk ,czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,3,0,86,320,0.0

112,113,hi everyone  i started at around 17 and a half stone maybe even 18 stone  i use to eat mcdonald s for breakfast  kfc for lunch and burger king or pizza hut for dinner  i would also snack on chocolate  crisps  and drunk a lot of fizzy drinks  when i first started exercising i would run for about 20 seconds then be sick   i would even get our of breath going up stairs  now i can run for about an hour  okay not run but a good jog  while exercising definitely helped changing my diet was the major factor in helping me loose weight  i now eat around 1500 calories a day then if i want pig out a little at the weekend  i still have about a stone to loose but i am so happy with the progress i have made  before pic  12 june 2013  http  iimgurcomvbrqw0ljpg after picture 12 feb 2016  http  iimgurcomxtyejoujpg http  iimgurcomozimvvpjpg be lucky ,45fut9,progresspics,lifestyle,1455298934,andy912,56,0,1,6,0.0

175,176,http  imgurcoma61f0d the only thing that helped me lose the weight was straight up hardcore cardio and dieting i was at my town s high school track by 5  30 am and ran at least 5 miles before 7 am i cut out all sugar and pop  reduced the size of my meals  and upped the frequency of meals i ate i ate nothing other than water past 7 if at all possible my daily caloric intake was around 1200  give or take down from a size 1820 to an 8 in pantsdresses and an xl to a sm in shirts goal weight is 135 have yet to start weight training due to nursing school  yay for no social life or time to do anything  and distaste of public gyms  my weight loss journey was prompted when my joint pain became severe from walking a flight of stairs i knew that if i continued my life the way i had been  i would probably not live to see 50 i still struggle when it comes to self confidence  but i think that s something most young women struggle with regardless of weight issues i still gravitate toward flowy shirts and nonform fitting clothing and still overestimate what size clothing i need ,45h740,progresspics,lifestyle,1455315337,maegan_kyleeee,200,0,1,5,0.0

294,295,my journey began on april 4  2015 i had extremely bad lower back pain  anxiety attacks  slight chest pains  i kept rubbing holes in the crotch of my jeans  i was depressed  my boyfriend and i fought all of the time  and i ate until i was physically ill  i finally decided to make a change and become a better me i downloaded myfitnesspal  began working out at the gym  and 11 months later here i am i m not happy that it took so long  but dammit i m proud i m here  i had a few slip ups in may i came down with a kidney infection if anyone here has dealt with that  you ll know exactly why i fell off of the wagon it was probably the most painful week i ve ever dealt with in august  i went on a cruise for a week and went into full party mode and over the holidays  i ll admit i was really relaxed with my eating  for the most part however  i ate between 12001500 calories a day mostly turkey  chicken or fish i ate red meats rarely because they were so much more expensive and higher calorie i began drinking protein shakes for breakfast or i would have an egg  two slices of bacon  toast or hash browns for breakfast if i had the time for lunch  i would have some sort of sandwich  grapes  apple  banana  cheese stick  whatever i was in the mood for  during this journey  i realized how easy it is to find low calorie things if you actually give a crap and try i quit making excuses for myself  got my mindset out of the fatlogic  and got my butt into gear  my lower back pain is gone  i no longer have chest pains  my jeans do nt rub holes  i weight lift and i m working towards jogging my first 5k  also  my boyfriend and i are much better and happier and he has now began getting into shape himself  thank you for taking the time to check out my post ,d00rve2,progresspics,lifestyle,1455554467,SwinginCrabWhacka,32,0,566,15176,0.0

460,461, imgur   https  imgurcomactajn  the first picture is on my wedding day  in august 2014 i m not sure how much i weighed then  but i think i was probably hovering between 240lbs and 245lbs i had nt stepped on a scale in who knows how long  and was pretty deep in denial about my weight i do remember that it was a struggle to get the dress done up  i had to suck in to get the zipper up  and most of that day was pretty physically uncomfortable having professional pictures done on the beach for over an hour while slogging through sand was a  nightmare   the second picture was taken a few days ago  i decided to try my dress on again to see if there was a difference well there s now a sizeable gap in the bust  and when i lifted my arms up  the dress fell right down  i was shocked  haha  i decided to start losing weight in august 2015  and my official sw is 236lbs it s been slow going  i have nt been as strict with counting calories as i should be  but i ve started keeping a closer eye on my intake again  i m aiming for my first goal of 180lbs by june    it  has  been coming off though  27lbs since september  it s not a huge amount of progress yet  and i still have a long way to go   but i m slowly getting there i ve been having issues seeing any difference in the mirror  but the dress really helped reaffirm that i m headed in the right direction i ca nt wait to see the end results ,461jh0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455610609,YouCussingWithMe_,65,0,1,40,0.0

565,566,i was told i should post this here i started at 360 a little less than a year ago after years of gaining weight and not recognizing myself in mirrors i wore size 5x shirts and 52waist  i now wear large shirts and 34 waist i joined a healthy lifestyle program at my local hospital i did nt have much hope for it but i thought if i was going to do i would be the best i lost 16lb the first two weeks i looked at if like beating a highs ore i wanted to have lost more each meeting than the last i was losing about 5 pounds a week  20 a month   i did so well my doctors want to use me as the poster child for their program i have given a couple speeches at medical conferences and i am currently working with a group of kids that are still in the program i just started a weight loss program at my school with the help of my doctors i want to show that anyone can lose weight and you do nt need to take pills or get surgery  unless absolutely necessary of coarse  to lose weight i remember seeing the p90x type commercials thinking that it was impossible for me to do i want to show people that anyone can change  i got so socially uncomfortable i pulled out of public school for two years i would go weeks without talking to anyone and it ruined my social skills but now i give speeches to groups of doctors and other kids in programs similar to my  one thing i try and tell people who ask me how i did is that you do nt have to work yourself to death everyday of coarse it wo nt be easy i started of just eating right and walking i then moved to working on my bowflex and now i focus are cardio which is my favorite i only eat fruits meats and vegetables i lowered my carb intake but that can be dangerous because your body needs carbs so i stick with rice i eat fruits whenever i get a sweet tooth sense they are natural sweeteners i have very little dairy intake my diet is very important because of my medical issues at my largest i was at the threat of getting thyroid cancer a swell as gynecomastia  which is very painful   the leg pain i was referring to was osgood shlaters  the tendon in the knee pulls apart after to much running now i have no signs of cancer and only take one pill for the gynecomastia  i took 4 for 6 months   the photo on the right is a month old about 15 pounds  i do nt like taking photos  sorry for typing so much feel free to ask any questions   ps i ve thrown those shoes out along with three trash bags of old clothes  i have love for fashion now that i can wear nice clothes ,d01eprh,progresspics,lifestyle,1455588739,Bendova1998,8,0,436,84,0.0

678,679,hi guys  i m not sure if i m doing this right i ve been looking at this subreddit for months now  just made an account today though  and i wanted to let you know that you guys inspired me to do this i d always had that idea that other people were skinny and healthy  i was just always going to be fat  but i stumbled across this subreddit one day and it was so inspiring  it gave me that push i needed to do something about my weight the dramatic differences people went through  and the time it took well it helped me realise that even if it was nt done in a day  it could be done  with a bit of hard work  anyway  i d always been super selfconscious about my weight  i was always a tubby girl and i was bullied in school about my weight in the last couple of years  i packed on the kilos rapidly  i ate way too much and moved way too little  it just made me feel even worse about myself than i already did i barely left the house and i avoided having photos taken of me or looking in the mirror i do nt know my exact starting weight because i could nt bring myself to look at the scales  so i put in 81kg  which is about what i weighed after i started seeing a little bit of a physical difference and decided to check my weight  the other day  i looked in the mirror and was happy with what i saw for the first time    anyway  i m not quite finished yet  my goal weight is still a ways to go  and after i lose the last few kilos  i m going to start with strength training  to build up some abs  but i thought i d post what i d done so far so that i could feel proud of my achievements  if anyone wants to know how i did it  it was pretty easy  i used myfitnesspal  restricted my calories without giving up the foods i loved  and joined a gym just to help speed up the process it took months and it was weeks until i saw any progress but if there s anyone out there thinking of losing weight and getting healthier  do nt worry  that first bit of progress is worth the weeks of nothing happening  it s almost addictive  i m so much more social and outgoing now  i feel healthier  more active  and finally i feel like i can be the person i want to be  so thanks  progresspics  i really owe it to everyone on here i still look up progress albums daily to keep me going  and i hope maybe my photos can do the same for someone else ,czyesqi,progresspics,lifestyle,1455368043,cinnamonbrook,12,0,103,11,0.0

2965,2966, before amp  after   http  mimgurcomaigytu  i posted in rloseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone s stories about being healthy and losing weight  mine basically started with the fact that i have depression which is something that i ve always had to deal with and always will but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca nt change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i m overweight  i hated how i could nt fit into any stylish clothes  just sweats and 2xl tshirts from walmart i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could nt fit into anymore i hated how i could nt go outside one of those pics i m in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that s not a very healthy way to live life  around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would nt miss for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go and then i cut out alcohol within the first month i lost 2530 pounds right there then i cut out red meat  which did wonders for my energy i also started walking everywhere workschoolshopping  and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs  you get the picture after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing  kick boxing and jiu jitsu i ve always loved mma and it s amazing what all of those  boxing especially  did for my muscle and weight loss really toned up my shoulders as well  i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do nt notice it and it s so good for you  just baby steps losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on   these are all pics of me throughout 2014 when i was at my heaviest  302 lbs    http  imgurcomanoeop   this is me as of last weekend   http  imgurcomamloql ,460os0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455595523,JMueller2012,74,0,23973,38032,0.0

3081,3082, imgur   https  imgurcomactajn  the first picture is on my wedding day  in august 2014 i m not sure how much i weighed then  but i think i was probably hovering between 240lbs and 245lbs i had nt stepped on a scale in who knows how long  and was pretty deep in denial about my weight i do remember that it was a struggle to get the dress done up  i had to suck in to get the zipper up  and most of that day was pretty physically uncomfortable having professional pictures done on the beach for over an hour while slogging through sand was a  nightmare   the second picture was taken a few days ago  i decided to try my dress on again to see if there was a difference well there s now a sizeable gap in the bust  and when i lifted my arms up  the dress fell right down  i was shocked  haha  i decided to start losing weight in august 2015  and my official sw is 236lbs it s been slow going  i have nt been as strict with counting calories as i should be  but i ve started keeping a closer eye on my intake again  i m aiming for my first goal of 180lbs by june    it  has  been coming off though  27lbs since september  it s not a huge amount of progress yet  and i still have a long way to go   but i m slowly getting there i ve been having issues seeing any difference in the mirror  but the dress really helped reaffirm that i m headed in the right direction i ca nt wait to see the end results ,461jh0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455610609,YouCussingWithMe_,67,0,1,40,0.0

3428,3429,i m 25lbs down  169 this morning    and still have another 15 to go  aiming for 155 i m enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body  from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal htwt should i knew that would mean slower progress  but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time  which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later when i first started midseptember  i used mfp religiously at this point i do nt use it very often  and instead keep a loose running total in my head  and monitoring my activity with my fitbit i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet  or when i forget the specifics of a certain food i ve found that strict calorie counting  using mfp  for instance  has tradeoffs for me i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably  which is great but  i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every daymostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life i think for some people it s quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it  for me it feels the opposite  like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger  more defining part of me than i m comfortable with so  i ve decided i m ok not doing it all the time  but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing  in terms of changes i ve made to eatinglifestyle  1 keto since midseptember  this has definitely changed my body s needscravings for food  and how i view food i still love the experience of food  but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy it s fuel  and also social  and also an experience  but mostly fuel   since about middecember i ve started doing intermittent fasting  if   though i do it more loosely than some do i usually have a fatty breakfast  2 eggs  a creditcard sized filet of salmon  half an avocado  and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream   then i eat nothing but coffee with creamhalf and half until dinner  which is usually around 68pm i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i m eating lots of carbs my blood sugar is level  so while some days i ll notice the absence of food  most days i do nt   started c25k in december   more generally  i m more purposeful in exercise i was already exercising a fair bit  36 halfhour walks a day with the dog  plus rock climbing during the week   in early december i got a fitbit  and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise i ve tried to just up my exercise slowly now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks  3 halfhour runs in the neighborhood  c25k has been great    and 2 hourlong rock climbing workouts at the gym since the beginning of january i ve also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts i use it for lower body  arms  and abs  slowly increasing how much time i do each for example right now i can do about 1056 minutes each on those using that app i recommend it  though it has some clunky parts  so yeah  25lbs down  15 to goi m excited to have passed a new decade on the scale  and i ve found this community very helpful and inspiring thanks for letting me lurk ,czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,4,0,86,320,0.0

3657,3658,http  imgurcoma61f0d the only thing that helped me lose the weight was straight up hardcore cardio and dieting i was at my town s high school track by 5  30 am and ran at least 5 miles before 7 am i cut out all sugar and pop  reduced the size of my meals  and upped the frequency of meals i ate i ate nothing other than water past 7 if at all possible my daily caloric intake was around 1200  give or take down from a size 1820 to an 8 in pantsdresses and an xl to a sm in shirts goal weight is 135 have yet to start weight training due to nursing school  yay for no social life or time to do anything  and distaste of public gyms  my weight loss journey was prompted when my joint pain became severe from walking a flight of stairs i knew that if i continued my life the way i had been  i would probably not live to see 50 i still struggle when it comes to self confidence  but i think that s something most young women struggle with regardless of weight issues i still gravitate toward flowy shirts and nonform fitting clothing and still overestimate what size clothing i need ,45h740,progresspics,lifestyle,1455315337,maegan_kyleeee,202,0,1,5,0.0

6279,6280, before amp  after   http  mimgurcomaigytu  i posted in rloseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone s stories about being healthy and losing weight  mine basically started with the fact that i have depression which is something that i ve always had to deal with and always will but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca nt change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i m overweight  i hated how i could nt fit into any stylish clothes  just sweats and 2xl tshirts from walmart i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could nt fit into anymore i hated how i could nt go outside one of those pics i m in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that s not a very healthy way to live life  around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would nt miss for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go and then i cut out alcohol within the first month i lost 2530 pounds right there then i cut out red meat  which did wonders for my energy i also started walking everywhere workschoolshopping  and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs  you get the picture after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing  kick boxing and jiu jitsu i ve always loved mma and it s amazing what all of those  boxing especially  did for my muscle and weight loss really toned up my shoulders as well  i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do nt notice it and it s so good for you  just baby steps losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on   these are all pics of me throughout 2014 when i was at my heaviest  302 lbs    http  imgurcomanoeop   this is me as of last weekend   http  imgurcomamloql ,460os0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455595523,JMueller2012,70,0,23973,38032,0.0

6806,6807,i m 25lbs down  169 this morning    and still have another 15 to go  aiming for 155 i m enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body  from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal htwt should i knew that would mean slower progress  but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time  which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later when i first started midseptember  i used mfp religiously at this point i do nt use it very often  and instead keep a loose running total in my head  and monitoring my activity with my fitbit i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet  or when i forget the specifics of a certain food i ve found that strict calorie counting  using mfp  for instance  has tradeoffs for me i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably  which is great but  i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every daymostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life i think for some people it s quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it  for me it feels the opposite  like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger  more defining part of me than i m comfortable with so  i ve decided i m ok not doing it all the time  but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing  in terms of changes i ve made to eatinglifestyle  1 keto since midseptember  this has definitely changed my body s needscravings for food  and how i view food i still love the experience of food  but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy it s fuel  and also social  and also an experience  but mostly fuel   since about middecember i ve started doing intermittent fasting  if   though i do it more loosely than some do i usually have a fatty breakfast  2 eggs  a creditcard sized filet of salmon  half an avocado  and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream   then i eat nothing but coffee with creamhalf and half until dinner  which is usually around 68pm i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i m eating lots of carbs my blood sugar is level  so while some days i ll notice the absence of food  most days i do nt   started c25k in december   more generally  i m more purposeful in exercise i was already exercising a fair bit  36 halfhour walks a day with the dog  plus rock climbing during the week   in early december i got a fitbit  and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise i ve tried to just up my exercise slowly now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks  3 halfhour runs in the neighborhood  c25k has been great    and 2 hourlong rock climbing workouts at the gym since the beginning of january i ve also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts i use it for lower body  arms  and abs  slowly increasing how much time i do each for example right now i can do about 1056 minutes each on those using that app i recommend it  though it has some clunky parts  so yeah  25lbs down  15 to goi m excited to have passed a new decade on the scale  and i ve found this community very helpful and inspiring thanks for letting me lurk ,czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,5,0,86,320,0.0

6887,6888, imgur   https  imgurcomactajn  the first picture is on my wedding day  in august 2014 i m not sure how much i weighed then  but i think i was probably hovering between 240lbs and 245lbs i had nt stepped on a scale in who knows how long  and was pretty deep in denial about my weight i do remember that it was a struggle to get the dress done up  i had to suck in to get the zipper up  and most of that day was pretty physically uncomfortable having professional pictures done on the beach for over an hour while slogging through sand was a  nightmare   the second picture was taken a few days ago  i decided to try my dress on again to see if there was a difference well there s now a sizeable gap in the bust  and when i lifted my arms up  the dress fell right down  i was shocked  haha  i decided to start losing weight in august 2015  and my official sw is 236lbs it s been slow going  i have nt been as strict with counting calories as i should be  but i ve started keeping a closer eye on my intake again  i m aiming for my first goal of 180lbs by june    it  has  been coming off though  27lbs since september  it s not a huge amount of progress yet  and i still have a long way to go   but i m slowly getting there i ve been having issues seeing any difference in the mirror  but the dress really helped reaffirm that i m headed in the right direction i ca nt wait to see the end results ,461jh0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455610609,YouCussingWithMe_,68,0,1,40,0.0

7757,7758,http  imgurcoma61f0d the only thing that helped me lose the weight was straight up hardcore cardio and dieting i was at my town s high school track by 5  30 am and ran at least 5 miles before 7 am i cut out all sugar and pop  reduced the size of my meals  and upped the frequency of meals i ate i ate nothing other than water past 7 if at all possible my daily caloric intake was around 1200  give or take down from a size 1820 to an 8 in pantsdresses and an xl to a sm in shirts goal weight is 135 have yet to start weight training due to nursing school  yay for no social life or time to do anything  and distaste of public gyms  my weight loss journey was prompted when my joint pain became severe from walking a flight of stairs i knew that if i continued my life the way i had been  i would probably not live to see 50 i still struggle when it comes to self confidence  but i think that s something most young women struggle with regardless of weight issues i still gravitate toward flowy shirts and nonform fitting clothing and still overestimate what size clothing i need ,45h740,progresspics,lifestyle,1455315337,maegan_kyleeee,205,0,1,5,0.0

10394,10395,i had bariatric surgery in august  1  my 40th birthday   http  iimgurcomuhdsswojpg   i weighed 441 pounds  1 in january 2014 i told myself that if i could give up diet pepsi  i d look into the surgery my last soda was 1114  2 in january 2015  i made an appointment with my primary care doctor before he had  rightly  refused to recommend me to the bariatric surgery program because he did nt think i was ready mentally i told him of my efforts to stop drinking soda  and we talked for a while he gave me the recommendation  4 29  the before  image on this post was taken at my body analysis  one of the requirements for the surgery  5 march  july   12 weeks of classes  once per week  5 august  surgery 6 august  now  continue to eat healthy  log everything i eat and drink exercise 4 days per week  lots of protein  7 21416  walk my 5k 8 the future  keep moving and working towards a healthy weight  my original goal was to get under 200 pounds however  i have revised that goal instead i will get to my recommended weight  125  135 pounds   i forecast it will take me another year  but i am determined to succeed   the health plan i have has one of the best programs in the country the main reason is the prep work you ca nt just walk in and get cut on you have to qualify  1 a referral from your doctor 2 complete a body analysis 3 take 12 classes that cover everything from what to expect from the surgery  how to eat before and after  how to exercise  mental health issues  interpersonal relationships  vitamins very comprehensive 4 complete lab work  including some gross stuff  5 complete and submit a weekly food journal 6 see a mental health professional 8 exercise 30 minutes a day 3  4 days per week 7 lose 10  of your weight  i lost 17  before  i took the program very seriously i ve tried every diet under the sun i felt like this was my last chance i did everything they wanted of me  i know some people will see i had surgery and think i took a short cut  the easy way out those people are wrong the surgery is a tool a very painful and exhausting tool it is not a cureall i did and am still doing the work i will have to keep it up for the rest of my life my life  that i can now see for the first time in a long time  exceeding 50 ,d00p8r8,progresspics,lifestyle,1455550234,trekbette,113,0,11138,56137,0.0

10997,10998,hi guys  i m not sure if i m doing this right i ve been looking at this subreddit for months now  just made an account today though  and i wanted to let you know that you guys inspired me to do this i d always had that idea that other people were skinny and healthy  i was just always going to be fat  but i stumbled across this subreddit one day and it was so inspiring  it gave me that push i needed to do something about my weight the dramatic differences people went through  and the time it took well it helped me realise that even if it was nt done in a day  it could be done  with a bit of hard work  anyway  i d always been super selfconscious about my weight  i was always a tubby girl and i was bullied in school about my weight in the last couple of years  i packed on the kilos rapidly  i ate way too much and moved way too little  it just made me feel even worse about myself than i already did i barely left the house and i avoided having photos taken of me or looking in the mirror i do nt know my exact starting weight because i could nt bring myself to look at the scales  so i put in 81kg  which is about what i weighed after i started seeing a little bit of a physical difference and decided to check my weight  the other day  i looked in the mirror and was happy with what i saw for the first time    anyway  i m not quite finished yet  my goal weight is still a ways to go  and after i lose the last few kilos  i m going to start with strength training  to build up some abs  but i thought i d post what i d done so far so that i could feel proud of my achievements  if anyone wants to know how i did it  it was pretty easy  i used myfitnesspal  restricted my calories without giving up the foods i loved  and joined a gym just to help speed up the process it took months and it was weeks until i saw any progress but if there s anyone out there thinking of losing weight and getting healthier  do nt worry  that first bit of progress is worth the weeks of nothing happening  it s almost addictive  i m so much more social and outgoing now  i feel healthier  more active  and finally i feel like i can be the person i want to be  so thanks  progresspics  i really owe it to everyone on here i still look up progress albums daily to keep me going  and i hope maybe my photos can do the same for someone else ,czyesqi,progresspics,lifestyle,1455368043,cinnamonbrook,11,0,103,11,0.0

22006,22007,my journey began on april 4  2015 i had extremely bad lower back pain  anxiety attacks  slight chest pains  i kept rubbing holes in the crotch of my jeans  i was depressed  my boyfriend and i fought all of the time  and i ate until i was physically ill  i finally decided to make a change and become a better me i downloaded myfitnesspal  began working out at the gym  and 11 months later here i am i m not happy that it took so long  but dammit i m proud i m here  i had a few slip ups in may i came down with a kidney infection if anyone here has dealt with that  you ll know exactly why i fell off of the wagon it was probably the most painful week i ve ever dealt with in august  i went on a cruise for a week and went into full party mode and over the holidays  i ll admit i was really relaxed with my eating  for the most part however  i ate between 12001500 calories a day mostly turkey  chicken or fish i ate red meats rarely because they were so much more expensive and higher calorie i began drinking protein shakes for breakfast or i would have an egg  two slices of bacon  toast or hash browns for breakfast if i had the time for lunch  i would have some sort of sandwich  grapes  apple  banana  cheese stick  whatever i was in the mood for  during this journey  i realized how easy it is to find low calorie things if you actually give a crap and try i quit making excuses for myself  got my mindset out of the fatlogic  and got my butt into gear  my lower back pain is gone  i no longer have chest pains  my jeans do nt rub holes  i weight lift and i m working towards jogging my first 5k  also  my boyfriend and i are much better and happier and he has now began getting into shape himself  thank you for taking the time to check out my post ,d00rve2,progresspics,lifestyle,1455554467,SwinginCrabWhacka,35,0,566,15176,0.0

26967,26968,march 2015  http  imgurcomecmkthw edit  february 2016  http  imgurcomefutvar recently started taking my cut really seriously to look good for spring break and summer and wanted to post results  to contextualize  i m a college senior who s been lifting since high school i used to go really hard with athletic builds  squats squats squats   but i now do more of a broppl split  though i have never tracked my progress on paper terrible i know  but i m at a point in my life where going to the gym every day before classes is enjoyable and helps maintain a great mindset and adrenaline rush i do nt feel a need to formally track progress  i entitled this the alcohol cut because my current lifestyle entails frequent partying  going out  enjoying life i had an idea of intermittent fasting and calorie counting in the before pic  but i had just let the weekends get out of hand one thing i realized looking at the before pics is that when i let myself go  i d rationalize it in my head in one ridiculous way or another  this summer i went on a vacation  saw pics of myself  and decided i was nt gon na let myself get any heavier i embarked on a cut  knowing in advance i would hit road bumps  food binges  weekends at the bar  tuesdays at the bar  etc  for the past month or so i ve dieted down to  1400 kcalday  knowing that while this is too low to maintain a productive metabolism  that i make up for it while drinking 34 nights a week and sorry  but it s not exactly drinking in moderation  this may not be the most ideal  the most productive or the most efficient way to get shredded  but i plan on taking it farther into the low 150shigh 140s and leangaining from there ,46675d,progresspics,lifestyle,1455678388,MSL_VT2016,9,0,49,87,0.0

28764,28765,http  imgurcoma61f0d the only thing that helped me lose the weight was straight up hardcore cardio and dieting i was at my town s high school track by 5  30 am and ran at least 5 miles before 7 am i cut out all sugar and pop  reduced the size of my meals  and upped the frequency of meals i ate i ate nothing other than water past 7 if at all possible my daily caloric intake was around 1200  give or take down from a size 1820 to an 8 in pantsdresses and an xl to a sm in shirts goal weight is 135 have yet to start weight training due to nursing school  yay for no social life or time to do anything  and distaste of public gyms  my weight loss journey was prompted when my joint pain became severe from walking a flight of stairs i knew that if i continued my life the way i had been  i would probably not live to see 50 i still struggle when it comes to self confidence  but i think that s something most young women struggle with regardless of weight issues i still gravitate toward flowy shirts and nonform fitting clothing and still overestimate what size clothing i need ,45h740,progresspics,lifestyle,1455315337,maegan_kyleeee,201,0,1,5,0.0

30987,30988,my journey began on april 4  2015 i had extremely bad lower back pain  anxiety attacks  slight chest pains  i kept rubbing holes in the crotch of my jeans  i was depressed  my boyfriend and i fought all of the time  and i ate until i was physically ill  i finally decided to make a change and become a better me i downloaded myfitnesspal  began working out at the gym  and 11 months later here i am i m not happy that it took so long  but dammit i m proud i m here  i had a few slip ups in may i came down with a kidney infection if anyone here has dealt with that  you ll know exactly why i fell off of the wagon it was probably the most painful week i ve ever dealt with in august  i went on a cruise for a week and went into full party mode and over the holidays  i ll admit i was really relaxed with my eating  for the most part however  i ate between 12001500 calories a day mostly turkey  chicken or fish i ate red meats rarely because they were so much more expensive and higher calorie i began drinking protein shakes for breakfast or i would have an egg  two slices of bacon  toast or hash browns for breakfast if i had the time for lunch  i would have some sort of sandwich  grapes  apple  banana  cheese stick  whatever i was in the mood for  during this journey  i realized how easy it is to find low calorie things if you actually give a crap and try i quit making excuses for myself  got my mindset out of the fatlogic  and got my butt into gear  my lower back pain is gone  i no longer have chest pains  my jeans do nt rub holes  i weight lift and i m working towards jogging my first 5k  also  my boyfriend and i are much better and happier and he has now began getting into shape himself  thank you for taking the time to check out my post ,d00rve2,progresspics,lifestyle,1455554467,SwinginCrabWhacka,31,0,566,15176,0.0

32768,32769,hi guys  i m not sure if i m doing this right i ve been looking at this subreddit for months now  just made an account today though  and i wanted to let you know that you guys inspired me to do this i d always had that idea that other people were skinny and healthy  i was just always going to be fat  but i stumbled across this subreddit one day and it was so inspiring  it gave me that push i needed to do something about my weight the dramatic differences people went through  and the time it took well it helped me realise that even if it was nt done in a day  it could be done  with a bit of hard work  anyway  i d always been super selfconscious about my weight  i was always a tubby girl and i was bullied in school about my weight in the last couple of years  i packed on the kilos rapidly  i ate way too much and moved way too little  it just made me feel even worse about myself than i already did i barely left the house and i avoided having photos taken of me or looking in the mirror i do nt know my exact starting weight because i could nt bring myself to look at the scales  so i put in 81kg  which is about what i weighed after i started seeing a little bit of a physical difference and decided to check my weight  the other day  i looked in the mirror and was happy with what i saw for the first time    anyway  i m not quite finished yet  my goal weight is still a ways to go  and after i lose the last few kilos  i m going to start with strength training  to build up some abs  but i thought i d post what i d done so far so that i could feel proud of my achievements  if anyone wants to know how i did it  it was pretty easy  i used myfitnesspal  restricted my calories without giving up the foods i loved  and joined a gym just to help speed up the process it took months and it was weeks until i saw any progress but if there s anyone out there thinking of losing weight and getting healthier  do nt worry  that first bit of progress is worth the weeks of nothing happening  it s almost addictive  i m so much more social and outgoing now  i feel healthier  more active  and finally i feel like i can be the person i want to be  so thanks  progresspics  i really owe it to everyone on here i still look up progress albums daily to keep me going  and i hope maybe my photos can do the same for someone else ,czyesqi,progresspics,lifestyle,1455368043,cinnamonbrook,14,0,103,11,0.0

39658,39659, imgur   https  imgurcomactajn  the first picture is on my wedding day  in august 2014 i m not sure how much i weighed then  but i think i was probably hovering between 240lbs and 245lbs i had nt stepped on a scale in who knows how long  and was pretty deep in denial about my weight i do remember that it was a struggle to get the dress done up  i had to suck in to get the zipper up  and most of that day was pretty physically uncomfortable having professional pictures done on the beach for over an hour while slogging through sand was a  nightmare   the second picture was taken a few days ago  i decided to try my dress on again to see if there was a difference well there s now a sizeable gap in the bust  and when i lifted my arms up  the dress fell right down  i was shocked  haha  i decided to start losing weight in august 2015  and my official sw is 236lbs it s been slow going  i have nt been as strict with counting calories as i should be  but i ve started keeping a closer eye on my intake again  i m aiming for my first goal of 180lbs by june    it  has  been coming off though  27lbs since september  it s not a huge amount of progress yet  and i still have a long way to go   but i m slowly getting there i ve been having issues seeing any difference in the mirror  but the dress really helped reaffirm that i m headed in the right direction i ca nt wait to see the end results ,461jh0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455610609,YouCussingWithMe_,64,0,1,40,0.0
39843,39844,http  imgurcoma61f0d the only thing that helped me lose the weight was straight up hardcore cardio and dieting i was at my town s high school track by 5  30 am and ran at least 5 miles before 7 am i cut out all sugar and pop  reduced the size of my meals  and upped the frequency of meals i ate i ate nothing other than water past 7 if at all possible my daily caloric intake was around 1200  give or take down from a size 1820 to an 8 in pantsdresses and an xl to a sm in shirts goal weight is 135 have yet to start weight training due to nursing school  yay for no social life or time to do anything  and distaste of public gyms  my weight loss journey was prompted when my joint pain became severe from walking a flight of stairs i knew that if i continued my life the way i had been  i would probably not live to see 50 i still struggle when it comes to self confidence  but i think that s something most young women struggle with regardless of weight issues i still gravitate toward flowy shirts and nonform fitting clothing and still overestimate what size clothing i need ,45h740,progresspics,lifestyle,1455315337,maegan_kyleeee,203,0,1,5,0.0
