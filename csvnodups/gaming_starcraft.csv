89,man  you had a really good chance to win that game but you made a couple of critical mistakes  1 that fight on the cliff at your third  the rocks need to be taken down asap you should start taking down the rocks with your first couple of zerglings once you ve pushed back the reapers as it s such an abusable position for the terran you also needed to split your army in half and attack the position at the top of the cliff and the bottom at the same time while right clicking all the liberators with your mutas and then focusing the medivacs down that try to escape you also needed more than 5 mutas  you could have had around 1015 mutas in that fight with about 30 more banelings with all the gas you had when the fight started you would have crushed that army  2 once you successfully beat his first push  just focus on expanding again  spreading creep  getting 33  ultras  adrenal glands and most importantly    chitinous plating    chitinous plating is actually the most important upgrade for ultras as they become almost unstoppable without a disgusting amount of liberators or ghosts in that counter attack with the 7 ultras you only had 2 armour upgrades plus 1 base armour for a total of 3 armour ultras that s why they melted to the marine stutter stepping if you had 33 plus 1 base armour plus chitinous plating which gives ultras an extra 4 armour for a total of 8 armour  you could have almost won the game outright with 7 ultras alone unupgraded ultras are pretty bad tbh but they become immortal tanking gods against marine heavy comps like his with the upgrades  so yeah  with a little fine tuning you definitely could have saved the 3rd hatch and crushed his army  and then a few minutes later with fully upgraded ultras and adrenal glands lings with more banelings  it would basically be gg for the terran you re definitely improving and i look forward to seeing your progress ,d02qfgx,starcraft,gaming,1455676820.0,Endoyo,2.0,0.0,2436,2027,0.0

106, i am a bot for those of you at work  i have tried to extract the text of the blue post from the battlenet forums   gt  gt     community feedback update  february 12    gt  gt  arkitas  community manager gt  gt  gt  gt       gt  gt  gt    map archetypes post   gt  gt  we wanted to give a shoutout this week to the post that came up describing a potential way to describe different map archetypes  due to how well thought out it was describing a map this way seems to be a great start in order to make sure we have good map diversity in terms of how rushecon heavy a map is  gt  gt  gt  gt  after discussing this post internally  we wondered if we can expand on this concept further so that we can make sure each map stands out in a cool way compared to other maps out there we think the 3x3 grid serves as a great way to define the alignment of a map  s economicaggressive characteristics we wonder though if this  alignment  concept should work alongside another attribute  a unique map  class   archetype  aspect  to give a more complete picture of a map for instance  maps like prion terraces might represent the class of maps which have easytoaccess high yield bases we could have many maps of this class over the seasons  varied in alignment from aggressive to economic we also believe there is room for more of these archetype concepts that really make a map stand out from what we  ve seen in the past  and we  d love to hear your ideas on other creative concepts which we can seek to use in maps of all types within this acre model  gt  gt  gt  gt    map cuts for season 2   gt  gt  we  ll be looking to cut a total of four maps for season 2 the obvious three map cuts would be the oldest three maps in the pool  ruins of seras  lerilak crest  and orbital shipyard of the remaining four maps   granted we want your feedback before we finalize  we were thinking the weakest map remaining is central protocol we received a map submission called  4  invader that is a similar idea to central protocol  but initially looks to be executed better so we  re currently thinking if we cut central protocol  invader could be a good new map to try in that slot to be clear however  we are waiting to review all map submissions before any decisions are finalized  gt  gt  gt  gt    other season 2 maps   gt  gt  we  ve also been reading up on and discussing various ideas throughout the past month or so  and we feel that we may have located a couple cool ideas so far  gt  gt  gt  gt  islandlike map gt  gt  the community has been discussing the idea of having a map that is not pathable by ground at certain stages of the game  and we  ve been looking closely into figuring out the exact points to attempt while having the map still be competitive here are the main points we  re considering on a map like this  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt   can scout early on to reduce the build order coin flip nature of island maps  gt  gt  gt  gt   earlymid game players choose to get into a more of a  island  position by breaking down rock towers  gt  gt  gt  gt   we would need to have enough bases for players to grab  we  re thinking around 34 at least that can  t be attacked by ground unless rocks are broken   gt  gt  gt  gt   late stage  the map would revert to more of a groundbased setup as rocks are broken down  opening up paths to the various bases  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  this approach allows us to move in small steps towards having maps that are more and more like an island  instead of potentially breaking the game by taking too big of a step at once we  d love to hear your thoughts  gt  gt  gt  gt    map with varying attack route considerations   gt  gt  another idea that we thought was interesting is playing around with the idea of having the main attack path to the opponent be easy to defend  and the alternate attack paths being extremely long by ground this way  more mobilitybased units andor air unitbased strategies could be more powerful here are some detailed points that we  d be trying to hit  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt   this type of map would not be a rush map  gt  gt  gt  gt   the main attack path would be a low ground path that leads up to a small ramp the defending player would have a big defender  s advantage if they are able to set up at the ramp outside of their base this area could also be blocked off with buildings and smaller numbers of defensive units  gt  gt  gt  gt   the alternate paths take a much longer travel along by ground  so mobile units would make a heavier usage of these paths  gt  gt  gt  gt   perhaps different paths could open up in the late game  so that the games on this map don  t drag on too much due to the main attack path being too easy to defend  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  and of course  we  ll always be on the lookout for additional suggestions  gt  gt  gt  gt  reaper strength gt  gt  there looks to be an interesting split regarding feedback here on the kr community side  we  re hearing a lot of feedback that zerg has no chance vs reapers in the early game  and on the nonkr side  we  re seeing a lot of reaper strength issues in tvt let  s keep a close eye on reaper strength going forward  and perhaps test a change on the next balance test map if it is needed  gt  gt  gt  gt    pvz ravager timing strength   gt  gt  we  re seeing a lot of feedback about the strength of early ravagers  and we  ve noticed the strength of ravager pushes in pvz while we aren  t sure that a change is definitely needed at this time  we agree that it would be good to be ready with a change by getting a balance test map going this way  if the strategy does indeed turn out to be problematic  we can patch right away  gt  gt  gt  gt  if we are to test a nerf to ravagers  we believe it might be good to test nerfing their ability against immobile units andor structures for example  if each shot damage was reduced or if the cooldown of the ability was increased a lot  or something along those lines this way  if we were to lean towards doing the siege tank medivac pick up removal in the future  tvz will definitely also be less affected as well  which would be a plus if we go with a different solution for tvt mech viability  we would most likely want to look for a different change here as well  gt

132,for ravager  reducing the damage would just make ravagers fall off even faster than they do now they are strong early but become easier to deal with later on if they directly nerfed the damage but added an upgrade for lair tech or later that might be good all around  early game timings ca nt just knock down your wallstanksbunkers so easily  but later on ravagers are just as strong as they are now  except you pay a bit extra to get that full damage  i wonder what the result would be from increasing the delay from launch to land time for bile  just a split second or so it would make ravagers harder to use overall  but it would make it a bit easier for stationary units to pick up and escape  which even pros are far from perfect at right now  not that it should be a guarantee  the pickupescapesplit interactions are a big part of why lotv is exciting to play and watch  but they might be a bit tough to pull off ,czxo00e,starcraft,gaming,1455306195.0,akdb,6.0,0.0,561,4300,0.0

400,zest played great but that match was sketchy  dark threw that game  whether it was intentional or not  dark is supposed to be a top level macro zerg but yet he could never secure a 5th base it got canceled 4  5 times  everytime by a paltry sum of units he had plenty of lurkers to secure his 4th base and plant 34 of them at his 5th base location to hold off a handful of zealots from canceling it over and over again  at 15  46 youtube vid time he moves his lurkers in the correct position to secure a 5th  at 16  00 when he s taking his 5th and zest pokes in he pulls them back to this 3rd base ramp where they re completely useless  they re not defending his 5th  they re not defending his 4th against a potential poke  he just takes them out of the fight his creep spread was abysmal even though he spent the entire time doing very minimal harass  turtling and macroing up  given the way the map is i m surprised he did nt use his 15 lurkers to hold off the choke in the middle of the map inbetween the indestructible rocks  instead of the choke in front his 4th base terrans have used libs and tanks to hold down that middle choke point to neutralize ultras dark had ample opportunity to lock down that choke to secure his half of the map 34 lurkers in 2 rows on both sides of that chasm and the choke is held  i m being a bit critical but this is one of the best zergs in the world  playing 1012 hours a day for the best team in the world teams that allegedly analyze every vod  work out all the kinks of what strat you re going to use and he made chobo gold level mistakes like that  ever since the life thing i m watching games with a more skeptical eye  still hats off to zest he did play a hell of a game    edit   sorry if this falls under  uncorroborated accusations  but i m just pointing out something i thought was sketchy ,d02d4ow,starcraft,gaming,1455657063.0,WunderWunsch,-3.0,0.0,1,64,0.0

520,well  after reading all those chat logs posted by desrow and screens from firecakes screen it seems like  1 admins told only firecake to wait casters to start a game and did nt tell it to sortof and it s not said in the rules about all games should be casted  2 firecake knowing that he should wait  created a lobby and invited sortof and played a game where he lost  3 after game admins said that that game does nt count because it was nt broadcasted and they should regame with rifkinzg invited  4 obviously sortof did nt want to rematch already won game and he was nt at fault in that situation  he was nt aware of that casters should be in game rifkin said sortof to choose  regame or forfeit and sortof choose forfeit and got additional 2 month ban from bttv tournaments  so from what i see  there re two sides that are wrong here  1 admins  for not telling both players that they should wait for casters i bet sortof would nt agree to start a game if he knew that  2 firecake  for starting a game  knowing that he should wait he said that he forgot  but seeing what he did for last yeah  i do nt buy it i still think that he is just a cunt  and sortof is innocent as a nun sad ,d02mpxx,starcraft,gaming,1455671153.0,gylka,55.0,0.0,1,305,0.0

558,hello starcraft community  i m not sure if i m posting this in the right place so please let me know if i m not so i can get rid of this and put it in the right place basically i m really into sc2 right now and i m in college but i live in li and have been playing a bunch lately unfortunately though  i know basically no one who actually plays this game consistently and i would love to connect with some people and make friends in the community i was thinking finding lan tournaments in a place in a place like manhattan would be ridiculously easy but i have been able to find exactly none i looked on team liquids site and just did some random googling but could nt find much of anything except for an iem that was held in new york a couple years back even if there was something in jersey or pennsylvania  i might not mind going but i have literally been able to find nothing where is it that i can find local tournaments for this game  is sc2 somehow just dead in one of the most lively cities on the planet ,463qxo,starcraft,gaming,1455646480.0,defusedbomb,7.0,0.0,1,9,0.0

659,they should ve just casted the replay and warned firecake sortof was not at fault at all imo the situation sucks now  since it even affects the loser bracket this could ve easily been avoided by bttv never should sortof have to play game 1 again  because firecake was told not to start the game without casters  not sortof  for the future they should clarify  that the player who hosts and starts the game will be held responsible in situations like this  edit  my assumption is that rifkin only told firecake not to start without casters if sortof was also told then both are to blame though  since he could just leave when he saw firecake started without casters   even then i think they should ve just warned both and casted the replay  just to keep things simple  but i believe sortof would not lie anyway https  twittercomsortofscstatus699737040640987138 edit 2  the fact that casters had to be in the game since it was a qualifying game is not in the rules http  wwwbasetradetvrules the relevant rule is on http  challongecomtingwcqual2 gt  if an admin request you hold your match  you must wait if you begin your match without admin approval  that score will not count  but only firecake was told to hold the match and not start without casters  sortof was not aware of this  edit 3  that rule is actually from qualifier 2 and is not even mentioned on today s tournament page  http  challongecomtingwcqual1,d02j4e6,starcraft,gaming,1455665507.0,Musicus,37.0,0.0,300,8074,0.0

673,this is probably the best advice i can give you  1 try not to compare the 2 games  they are very different in gameplay and overall feel  2 watch a decent amount of games  as well as play a decent amount of games  before you decide which race is for you go for whichever suits the player you want to be  not the one you think is coolest  unless you are torn between 2  then use the coolness factor   above all  have fun  do nt get too down after a loss  watch the replay and find what you did right and wrong etc ask for help on here and on discord and we ll sort you out at the beginning it s mainly  play more   but sometimes there are specifics  the  wiki   https  wwwredditcomrstarcraftwikinew  has some great videos  i d check those out if i were you  glhf ,d02oeuf,starcraft,gaming,1455673714.0,RewardedFool,3.0,0.0,0,0,

777,i feel that if reapers are viewed by most people as op in tvz and tvt they probably just need a nerf i m not sure this is a situation where lets wait and see  really helps like  in the two matchups where they see the most play they re viewed as too powerful they re early game units too so its not like someone needs to try a different army comp or build order its pretty set in stone that reapers do reaper things and that s the issue in zvt and tvt so i m not clear what they re waiting for but whatevs  i would nt be opposed to nerfing ravager damage vs shields i think nerfing damage vs structures and immobile units is dangerous because they re so so important at breaking siege lines and bunkers in zvt and spines in zvz but i can absolutely understand if they want to nerf ravager shots vs shields roach ravager pushes before disruptors are out deal almost guaranteed damage as long as the zerg does nt mess up most of the time imo ,czxlyny,starcraft,gaming,1455303345.0,PcaKestheaod,1.0,0.0,11017,25394,0.0

781,for ravagers  you want to nerf their ability to 3 shot sieged units and other static defensesbuildings  but you do nt want the ability nerfed for other units simple solution  reduce the total damage of the ability  but increase the splash range that way  static units would take more shots to kill mobile units will take less damage from a direct shot  but the damage would be balanced by spreading it to more units that are clumped  requiring slightly better mobile unit micro to completely avoid the ravager shots  that would also help against mobile air units that are near impossible for ravagers to currently hit with bile it may take more shots  but at least the air units have a better chance of taking some damage ,czxpkdy,starcraft,gaming,1455308456.0,upL8N8,2.0,0.0,1,171,0.0

786,another example of how blizzard is really listening to the community  especially the islandtype map that was mentioned this one more than some other community feedback posts imo  glad to see the players and the game company interacting more than before those of us around in the raxbeforedepot era of wol know too well how a lack of communication can result in bad game balance for every party involved   there looks to be an interesting split regarding feedback here on the kr community side  we  re hearing a lot of feedback that zerg has no chance vs reapers in the early game  and on the nonkr side  we  re seeing a lot of reaper strength issues in tvt  i think this has to do solely on the game dynamics of how korean players execute their strategies opposed to the rest of the world notorious for theorycrafting beyond belief and getting builds down to the very second  this could stem from how aggressive terran players are in korea compared to the nonkr regions note how the korean play of z differs from the nonkr play of z   in regards to the map pruning  it d be nice to see maybe some type of ingame poll where we can test the maps for a certain amount of time and blizzard devs can focus on community feedback  maybe weigh pro players  insight as well to create a balance between casual and not  and make a decision that way or something of the like ,czxlrpu,starcraft,gaming,1455303078.0,jeffkangkim,17.0,0.0,0,0,
787,if ravagers get changed a good amount  almost every game vs t or p will be hatch first every single game furthermore  the ravager build vs protoss is akin to protoss going for proxy gateways if it s scouted then protoss holds rather easily if they do nt scout  well  information is power and does nt double gate openers deal super well vs a 3 ravager push  you get out stalkers and it s pretty easy ,czxpoon,starcraft,gaming,1455308627.0,Wicclair,2.0,0.0,1419,395,0.0

836,for the last 4 months or so i have been messing around with diagonally mirroed maps  which in my opinion is a type of symmetry that s not very much seen in the mpamaking community other than the random 2p map with a  8 based core layout   http  wwwteamliquidnetforumsc2maps5041054smaktvbastion  1   but anyhow for the longest time i have had in my mind try to create a diagonally symmetric 4p map with a 8 based core layout  and man they are hard to tackle  the 8 core layout is already hard because you are basically throwing away valuable map space in the area in front of the player s base  and 4p maps are known for being very restrictive when it comes to having map space to work with  and even with those very strong restrictions after a good while of working on bastion i have come up with something that i m fairly happy with  of course concessions had to be made  yet as i said  i m quite content with the results  and i ll keep working on trying to create a 4p map that has the initial ideas i wanted bastion to end up with  anyways  as the linked map entry says at the end  even when i did nt achieved to do everything i had in mind for the map  i still feel that i managed to get to a map that s more solid than had i done all the initial ideas  hope you guys enjoy give the map a try or two  and if you have feedback or simply general ideas do nt doubt to post here or contact me if you want  gt     map info and links    gt    map size    176x176 gt    close spawn s rush distance    238 gt    close spawn s nat to nat distance    178 gt    cross spawn s rush distance    290 gt    cross spawn s nat to nat distance    230 gt    size of natural ramp leading to the third    standard 2x sized ramp  gt   tl thread   http  wwwteamliquidnetforumsc2maps5041054smaktvbastion  1 ,d012cmv,starcraft,gaming,1455569625.0,Kantuva,8.0,0.0,6584,17317,0.0

1058, teamliquid thread   http  wwwteamliquidnetforumsc2maps5041622avexnamaste    map is available on all servers    the gold natural has two size 1 ramps entering from the small rush distance northern passage  but the choke into the main and natural from the gold base is a 4 mineral wall choke  50 minerals each   meaning one can punish a gold base  but not abuse that position to attack the main or circumvent the natural one of the ramps at the gold can also be completely closed off  the natural then has two possible ramps  inspired by blizzard s recent discussion on rush distances and how they feel about them in maps like ulrena the fastest path is the north side to the gold bases  with a choke closer to the bases the middle path is a pretty normal distance for smaller maps  and the bases are reasonably defended the lowground third has rocks that allow it to be safely taken  as well as prevent that ramp to be abused by players attacking the natural   that ramp can be used to attack the natural from a longer route  or break the rocks inbetween  the middle of the map has quite a few areas that can be used in terms of skirmishing  and this map  in my opinion  reminds me of how blitz x is structured  let me know what you think  and be sure to check out any of my other maps   i ve made a directory for all my work on teamliquid  maps  ports  etc check it out here    http  wwwteamliquidnetforumsc2maps502455theavexultimatedirectory  avex  you can contact me on twitter  sc2_avex if you need anything ,d02jlkk,starcraft,gaming,1455666241.0,Avexyli,3.0,0.0,3199,5342,0.0

1630,i agree  but its a tough road to go down streamers need viewers  and smurfing brings viewers  look at dragon and winter guys like crank do troll builds with their already high mmr and struggle with viewers sometimes  even though his skill and game play is on another level its obvious when your playing against someone who is 3 or four leagues above you based on what you scout  and i just ask them not too smurf and leave the game it sucks because climbing the ranks is the reason too ladder mostly and smurfing ruins that  yes  getting better is a reason also   winter introduced the idea of smurfing to the mainstream iirc  and there really is no way to stop it i do nt give them the time of day when i know i m being trolled ,d01adob,starcraft,gaming,1455581876.0,CobrAKush,2.0,0.0,1,129,0.0
